   CHAPTER I.

.. vspace:: 2

Britton's steam-yacht tore out its lungs in
protest at the black smudge of a coasting vessel
reeling straight across its bows.

The siren bellowed thrice in a choking fury
of warning and denunciation till the echoes
boomed over the Algerian harbor and floated
high up to the Mustapha Supérieure, where
English lords slept at peace in luxurious hotels.

Disconcerted by this tremendous volume of
sound, the coaster vacillated, veered and yawed
as if under some drunken steering-hand, to leap
forward unwarily and bury her weather-beaten
prow in the white side of the *Mottisfont*.

The terrific impact swept the yacht's forecastle
clear of snoring sailors, and, after shooting the
temporary owner headlong from his berth,
commenced to polish the companionway passage with
his features, an operation which he instinctively
though not wholly wakefully resented by a
frantic grasping for something substantial.

The effort was rewarded when his fingers
clutched the lower stairs, and Rex Britton
staggered to his feet.  Every light below was out,
and the man so roughly aroused stood dazedly
wondering if a horribly real nightmare held him
in its grip.

Then, like a flash, intelligence permeated his
shaken brain, and all the faculties stirred again.
He remembered the grinding crash and
clambered on deck in his pyjamas!

Upon the bridge loomed the figure of the
captain, frantically banging at the engine-room
signals, but the bell refused to sound.  A medley of
curses vibrated in the humid night air,
emanating partly from the lower deck, and partly from
the bows of the coaster as the Berber sailors
gave free vent to their displeasure.

"Daniels–Captain Daniels!" roared Britton,
"what the deuce is this turmoil?"

"An accident, sir," was the reply.  "A
coasting vessel has rammed us.  I'm afraid we're
badly hit; and the signals are out of business.
We'll reverse in a moment if the engines are not
disabled."

He waved a sailor down with the order to the
engine-room.  The big yacht trembled under the
mighty strain and began to creep backward,
inches at a time, since the nose of the other craft
was tightly wedged in its vitals.

Britton was beside the captain in a moment,
with a perfect stream of questions as to details
and responsibility.

"The coasting steamer was entirely at fault,
sir."  Daniels gravely assured him.  "She cut
across our bow in spite of three warnings.
Judging by her careening, the wheelsman was very
drunk!"

An increased throbbing of the *Mottisfont's*
engines made the whole hull shiver, and the yacht
scuttled backward from the coaster like an
immense crab.

"She sinks! she sinks!" rose the cry from the
sailors on the poop.

"What is sinking?" cried Britton, excitedly;
"not the yacht!"

"No, the coaster," said Captain Daniels.
"She has no water-tight compartments."

The terrified wail of the Arab crew proclaimed
the inrush of the water as the steamer listed at
an alarming rate to starboard.  The officers
shouted orders which were smothered in the
tumult, for an uncontrollable panic seized
passengers and sailors.  Pandemonium in its wild,
selfish authority ruled on the coaster's decks, and
Britton, from the bridge of the *Mottisfont*, could
view the mad, strenuous struggle for safety.  A
feminine cry startled him in its piercing shrillness.

"Good heavens!" he exclaimed, "there are
women there, and those brutes of Berbers will
trample them to death.  Quick, man!  Drive the
yacht in close and throw out the ropes."

Daniels instantly obeyed, observing: "It's
dangerous work, sir, and she's liable to drag us
down when she founders, which may be any moment now!"

"Doesn't matter," said Britton, curtly.
"We're bound to help them even if this was their
own doing.  Have you lowered the launch?"

"Mr. Ainsworth and Mr. Trascott have it, sir."

"The smaller boats?"

"They're out, sir, trying to take some of the
passengers off.  Why in the name of Neptune
don't they lower their own?"

The *Mottisfont* was larger than the steamer,
and overtopped it as they drew in again.
Britton leaned forward and listened to the tumult on
the smaller vessel.

"I'm afraid they're fighting for their own
boats," he said, quickly.  "The panic's getting
worse."

The hubbub was redoubled.  A woman's scream,
sharp and piteous, was cast despairingly on the
night.  Britton muttered something like an oath,
and swinging down from the bridge he ran
forward with all speed.

"Anyone in the turret?" he yelled to the group
of sailors straining on the ropes.

"No, sir," answered the first mate.  "The
lookout was thrown to the deck when we struck.
His shoulder is broken."

"Go up yourself," ordered Britton.  "See if
the searchlight works, and turn it on the coaster.
We are only groping like blind men in the dark."

Turning to the second mate, he added: "Fire
that brass cannon at intervals to call out the
harbor boats.  I see the usefulness of it after
all!"

Leaving the mates to execute his orders,
Britton sprang to the taffrail and vaulted at hazard
down into the struggling mass of humanity that
surged over the steamer's forehold.  He landed
squarely upon an Arab's back, knocking that
swarthy individual into the lee scuppers, but
without pausing to unravel the puzzling Algerian
profanity which was thus elicited, Britton pushed
his way aft.

He could feel the vessel rock to the roll of the
water in the hold as the weight above was
continually and suddenly shifted, and he knew that
with one of those evolutions she would roll a
little too far.  There would be no recovery, and
the steamer would turn turtle.

About the stern-davits a struggle raged.  The
forward boats were stove in with the force of the
collision, and only four were left intact.  The
brown-skinned Berber sailors endeavored to
lower them, and blue-coated officers vainly
attempted to keep them back and to preserve order
among the demented people.

One boat got away as Britton came up.  The
yacht's searchlight, pricking out of the gloom,
showed the craft to be full of Arabs, while women
and children were wailing in supreme terror
upon the foundering vessel.

The crowd swayed to the rail as another boat
was slung from the davits.  Rex grasped the arm
of a man in marine uniform.

"Where's your captain?" he demanded, harshly.

"I am the captain," said the man, helplessly;
"but what can I do?  The passengers have gone
mad!  The Berbers are beasts!"

Britton flung aside the arm he had seized with
a gesture of repulsion.

"Do?" he cried, in fine scorn.  "You might at
least try!  You act like a baby.  This rush must
be stopped–"

Boom! rang the *Mottisfont's* cannon.  Its
message reverberated like hollow thunder over the
great bay.  Two score whistles rose in answer
from the inner reaches of the harbor.

Boom!  The whistles shrieked anew, and the
riding lights of the vessels plunged into activity.

"You hear!" exclaimed Britton.  "If that
rush isn't stopped half of those on board will be
drowned by the swamping of the boats, with a
hundred harbor craft coming to the rescue.
Come on, sir–be a man!"

Rex took hold of a heavy piece of broken
stanchion and made a flying leap into the knot of
Berbers stamping about the stern davits.

"Back, men!" he shouted in a voice that
soared above every other noise.  "Be calm!
There'll be a hundred boats here in a minute,
with room for all of you.  Let the women
forward at once!"

A female figure sprang to the davits at his
words, but the Arabs roared their dissent and
charged in a body.  Britton had a vision of a
girlish form with an ethereal face and pale-gold
hair, tossed rudely in the rush of men.  She lost
her footing suddenly and went down with a
suppressed scream.

Snarling like an enraged animal, Rex leaped in
front of them.

Crack! sounded his stanchion on the foremost
head.  Crack! crack!  He pierced their ranks
and dragged out the luckless woman.  Shielding
her with one arm, he was carried back against
the ship's side by the pressure of the frantic
throng.

"Are you hurt?" he found time to whisper.

"No–only frightened," she sobbed.  The
nervous strain was too much for her.

Britton made her kneel down under the rail
behind him, and, with his legs protecting her
from the trampling, he faced the angry Arabs
again.

They had hesitated a little, daunted by the
impetuosity of his attack.  The Englishman's
blood was now thoroughly aroused.  Away back
in his line of ancestors there had been knights of
the old regime; there were soldiers of the empire
among the later generations; and his
grandfather had fallen at Waterloo.  The fighting,
bulldog strain was in him, and only sufficient
baiting was required to bring it into evidence!

Boom! sounded the *Mottisfont's* cannon for
the third time.  Across the mysterious stretch of
bay the shout of rowers answered.

"They're coming!" exclaimed Britton,
triumphantly.  "You pack of fools, have you no
sense?"

A growl was the reply.  Whether fear had
driven out their understanding, or whether the
rough fellows were actuated by a desire of
revenge for the blows inflicted by the
Englishman, they rushed upon him once more.

"Ah! you will have it, will you?" he cried,
exulting in the mere thrill of battle.  "Then lay
on, you rabble!"

He stood in the central focus of the
steam-yacht's searchlight, with muscle action
unhampered and with bare feet gripping the deck
firmly, while his enemies strove to reach him.
His stanchion rose and fell like a flash as he
circled in and out, avoiding the blows of his
adversaries, and every time he struck a man went
down.  Once a sinewed Moroccan locked with
him, and he felt the sting of steel in his shoulder,
but a jolt on the fellow's neck from Britton's
other arm stretched him senseless, while the knife
clattered over the rail into the sea.

Crack! crack!  The sound of his club grew
monotonous; the soft, warm trickle of something
down his left shoulder filled him with a strange
disgust for the combat; he felt ashamed of
himself standing in pyjamas on the lighted deck of
another ship and striking down Berbers with a
stanchion.

Since it was wholly necessary, the Englishman
wondered at the sense of shame.  Perhaps it was
an odd trick which the wounded nerves in his
arm were playing him.

Only three or four Arabs opposed Britton now.
He ran at them with hands placed wide on his
stanchion, like a wand, and swept them aside.
The captain of the steamer stepped through into
the cleared space on the after-deck.

"Give your orders," said Britton, with a sigh
of relief.

He turned to the woman by the rail and raised
her up as the feminine contingent was passed to
the side and lowered into the harbor boats which
were already alongside.

"You may enter one of them now," he said,
marvelling vaguely at her perfect face.  She
touched his arm with a movement of gratitude,
but her fingers came away wet and sticky.

"Someone slashed you!" she exclaimed in
concern.  "Let me see.  Oh, let me bandage it.
And I was the cause of your wound!"

"It is only a flesh wound–" began Britton.

"Madam, the boat!" interrupted the anxious
captain.

"I'll wait," answered the woman.  "This man
is wounded–the man who saved all of us.  Can't
you do something?  See! he's weak!"

She gave an alarmed cry as the Englishman
staggered.  He saved himself by clutching the rail.

"It must–have been those–those circles I
cut among the rascals," he laughed unsteadily.
"They make me dizzy."

"You're evading," she said quickly; "it's the
Berber's knife."

With a strong effort Britton summoned his
will-power to control his weakened nerves, and
roughly dashed a hand across his eyes.  It was
with a great sensation of relief that he felt his
returning steadiness of muscle, and he glanced
at the rope ladders which filled the waiting boats
with fleeing people.

"We had better be getting down," he advised.
"The steamer will not float long."

Even as he spoke, the coaster lurched
alarmingly.  Rex grasped the woman's arm and drew
her quickly to the rail.

A thrown rope whipped his cheek, and he
caught it skilfully, peering below at a small boat
which swayed to the roll of the steamer.

"For God's sake, Britton, come off that old
hulk," shouted someone.  "She's sinking fast!"

Rex looked downward with the pleased expression
on his own face contrasting strangely with
the anxious countenances of the two occupants
of the launch.

"It's my friends, Ainsworth and Trascott, from
the yacht," he explained to the woman at his side.

"I was beginning to wonder why they hadn't
showed up.  You see they must have been out
before I awakened, for they had taken the launch
to the rescue."

"Come off!" commanded Ainsworth, peremptorily.
"Can't you see you're last, you two
mooning fools?  The old coffin will drop in a
minute."

They could hear Trascott's mild protest at
Ainsworth's trenchant phrasing of the situation,
and Britton laughed.

"Trascott's a curate," he said, disengaging
a rope ladder for their own use, "a very
orthodox, English curate!  Sometimes he doesn't
approve of his friend's strenuous speech.  You'll
have to overlook it, though.  Ainsworth is a
lawyer, and he thinks he has us in the witness-box."

They were descending the rope-ladder as he
spoke, the lady going first, and Cyril Ainsworth
heard the last part of his host's comment.

"It's no witness-box you're in, Britton," he
growled.  "It's a bally old tub, and you needn't
think because you're dressed in beautiful, silk
pyjamas that you must stay there till you have
to swim.  If I were the lady, I would vigorously
object to getting wet."

Ainsworth emphasized his tirade with a swift
revolution of the engine-crank.  The curate cast
off the rope, and they puffed away from the
water-logged vessel.  Gleaming white against the inky
color of her side was the nameplate–*Constantine*.

Britton pulled an overcoat and a pair of
sea-boots from a locker and put them on.

"That's better," grunted the lawyer.  "You
don't look so much like a posing matinee idol
in crimson jersey and biceps!"

Britton apparently did not hear him, being
intent upon the dénouement of this harbor
tragedy.  Under the *Mottisfont's* powerful
search-light everything stood out nakedly clear for rods
around.  The stricken vessel rolled in a last,
pitiful struggle, listed too far for the recovery
of her equilibrium, turned turtle and sank like a
stone.

"There's the end of incompetence," rasped
Ainsworth, while the lady beside Britton gave a
sympathetic cry, and the fleet of boats flying from
the vortex peril with their human cargoes echoed
in choruses of dismay.

"Had you friends?" Britton asked of the woman.

"No,–only my maid and baggage," she
answered.  "My name is Morris, Maud
Morris–and I was travelling alone."

"To Algiers?"

"Yes, to Algiers–at least temporarily."

"Then the inconvenience is not considerable,"
Britton said.  "We will go on board the yacht,
and I can find your maid in the morning."

"Ah! you are too generous," murmured the
lady.  "You have already done more than a
woman can repay, and I have not even attended
to your wound.  Does it pain much?"

"Very little," replied Britton, lightly.  "I
believe I shall hold you to your promise to
bandage it, and I believe it will get well very soon."

She laughed a low, sweet laugh which harmonized
with her pale beauty, and Britton felt some
unexplained fascination as her green-blue eyes
held his.

The launch bumped the *Mottisfont's* side abaft
of the great hole which the *Constantine's* prow
had torn.  The occupants surveyed the black,
yawning break somewhat ruefully before they
stepped on deck.

"What the deuce will the Honorable Oliver
Britton say when he finds his nephew has smashed
up his floating palace?" asked Ainsworth, meditatively.

"My honorable uncle will never see it till it
is restored to its original state," Rex answered.
"And the Moroccan Steamship Company, owners
of the *Constantine*, will pay for the restoration."

"What a legal beacon you might have been!"
sighed Cyril, generously.  "But this pin-scratch
they gave you in the arm!––who pays the
doctor-bill?"

"That is my affair," said the lady of the
adventure, very sweetly, "and it is time it was given
attention."  She took Britton's sleeve and drew
him to the companionway.  There Rex paused and
hailed the bridge.

"Daniels, get us in close to the eastern jetty
at once and anchor there.  We don't know how
badly we're damaged, so moor right under it."

"Aye, aye, sir," the captain answered.

"And send me the steward," Britton added.

"Here he is, sir!  Bannon, go forward."

The portly form of the steward joined the two
by the stairs.

"Bannon, have your wife prepare a stateroom
for Miss Morris at once," said Britton, "and
bring us some linen strips for bandages."

"You're hurt, sir?" said the steward.

"Only scratched!  Water and linen is all I want."

Bannon brought it as directed, and having
given the simple necessaries to the lady, Britton
dived below to reappear some minutes later in
yachting trousers, shirt and shoes, with his left
sleeve rolled up to the shoulder and his duck coat
on his other arm.  He had washed the knife-wound
while in his bath-room, but it bled afresh,
and the lady hastened to staunch it.

Trascott assisted her by the use of much cold
water.  When the flow of blood was stopped, she
called into requisition some healing ointment
which Bannon had brought on his own authority
and then bound the limb neatly with linen.  There
was something exquisite in the sensation for
Britton.  The soft touch of her fingers, the near
fragrance of her person and the electric glow of
awakened sympathy combined to influence him
and awake strange thrills to which he was not at
all subject.

She felt the throb of his pulse as she held his
wrist down to straighten the bandage, and the
knowledge of its origin flushed her cheek.  An
instant she looked up at him inquiringly, almost
with the spirit of challenge, but her lashes
drooped under the tensity of his glance.

Virility was Britton's most salient attribute.
When the man in him was stirred, it moved
strongly, and the proximity of so fair a vision
would have excited a less impressionable person,
one with less of Britton's youthful and unbounded
faith in women!

The steward disappeared about his business.
Trascott and Ainsworth loitered away.  Britton
and the woman were left alone with that magnetic
bond of touch binding them.  With the man, the
impression lasted for many a day!  A new,
uncurbed power was loosed within him, and the
woman felt the trend of its might.  It thrilled
and awed at the same time.  She shifted her
hands to a final arrangement of the bandage.

"I think it will do," she murmured in a confused way.

Britton shook himself out of a wild dream,
slowly fastened his shirt-sleeve and donned his coat.

"We will go below," he said, taking her arm
and guiding her down the companionway.  The
stewardess met them in the passage and led the
way to the stateroom she had prepared,
disappearing therein.

"Good-night," she said, extending both hands.
"I haven't found much opportunity to thank
you.  To-morrow I shall tell you more."

Britton took her fingers, and the mad blood
leaped in his veins again.

"To-morrow," he cried gladly.  "Ah! yes,
there are many to-morrows, for you stay at
Algiers."

"Many to-morrows!" she exclaimed with a
happy laugh, as she turned into the stateroom.
"That is a sweet way of putting it.  Many
to-morrows!–I like that idea."

"It's hell,–isn't it, Trascott?" asked Ainsworth, dismally.

"My dear fellow," protested the shocked
curate, "such liberty of expression, to put it
mildly–"

"Fudge!" interrupted his friend.  "You
divines all agree as to the existence of an infernal
region.  Why shouldn't I introduce a comparison
if I choose?  If you don't like its rugged exterior
you can at least appreciate the sentiment.  It's
hell–isn't it?"

"Well, well, it's decidedly unpleasant,"
grumbled Trascott.

"It's a bally shame!" said the lawyer, tritely.
"Britton takes us away on his uncle's yacht for a
cruise of the African shore of the Mediterranean.
Witness our cruise!  We get as far as Algiers and
there his two long-suffering comrades have to
stagnate while he plays the gallant to a blonde
will-o'-the-wisp whom he made a show of
rescuing.  He found her maid, installed her at the
Hotel de ––, attended to her remittances from
England in her stranded position and played the
modern hero role to a triple curtain
call–which he is certainly getting!"

"Of course the yacht had to be repaired," put
in Trascott, as if it was his kindly duty to find
some extenuation.

"Of course!" echoed Ainsworth sarcastically,
waving a hand to where the *Mottisfont*, quite
intact, rode proudly at anchor.

The two men were standing on the harbor piers
above the landing-stages, and they had a good
view of the vessel.  Behind them the capital of
Algeria rose precipitously up the sides of an
immense hill a mile in length at the base by five
hundred feet in height.  The foot of the
picturesque city was the sprawling sea; the head was
the Casbah, the ancient fortress of the Deys.  Up
on the hill reposed the old or high town with its
quaint Moorish edifices, while sloping below to
the rim of the port lay the lower, new, or French
town filled with government buildings, squares
and streets, together with lines of warehouses
and wharves, dotted here and there by mosques
that looked strangely out of place amid the
European architecture.

Blocked out against the harbor water from
their conspicuous stand, the two friends were
very dissimilar in appearance.  Ainsworth's was
the short, squat figure, Trascott's the tall, lanky
one.  The lawyer, in spite of the disadvantage of
height, probably weighed more than the curate.
His stockily-built body filled out his gray tweeds,
while the black garments of Trascott hung loosely
on his hollow frame.  A gray cap of the same
material as his suit was jauntily perched on the
lawyer's head, but his companion wore the
familiar and inevitable round, dark hat.

Still, if Trascott's form lost dignity beside
Ainsworth's, that dignity was more than regained
when it came to a comparison of faces.  The
lawyer had a gray-eyed, regular countenance,
smooth and unmarked by any dissipation, but
it lacked the shading that beautified his friend's.
The curate's features, though more rugged in
casting, had the high lights of earnestness glowing
in his brown eyes, the deeper tones of endeavor
blending in the moulding of the chin, while the
shadows of responsibility rested in the firm curve
of his lips.

Cyril Ainsworth, with his unchanging mask of
precision, was the keen, well-oiled machine which
cut straight to the core of things in the
performance of its work.  Bertrand Trascott was the
living actor of a great belief, the exponent of a
mighty drama calculated to uplift and regenerate
his fellow-beings.  Each had his part in the work
of the present-day world, and, strange to say,
men loved the machine-like precision of
Ainsworth almost as well as the generous heart of
Trascott.

The lawyer again called the curate's attention
to the yacht with another motion of his hand.

"The yacht had to be repaired," he snapped.
"It took three days to splice the timbers and
rivet the plates.  We should then have proceeded
with our cruise.  There was no impediment, for
the steamship company settled the damages in
full.  Yet here we have been for two weeks–and
so has the woman!  At this rate we may
be here for two months–and so may the woman!"

They sat down upon the piers for their
after-supper smoke, having fared sumptuously on board
the *Mottisfont*, in an effort to reconcile
themselves to the inertia under which they chafed.
The soft dusk began to glide in from the sea and
enfold the dark wharves in misty wreaths.  One
by one the riding lanterns of the harbor vessels
shone out like stars in a fog, and the rhythm of an
Arab sailor song came swelling over the broad bay.

The two friends smoked in silence as the dusk
grew deeper.  Presently the beacon light flashed
up on Matifou ten miles away, sending out its
nightly warning to the ships at sea.  A thousand
lamps flared in the lower town, and far up the
hill the boulevard lanterns starred the gloom
with their fiery eyes.

"Can you tell me the space of time an Algerian
romance requires?" asked Ainsworth, finally.

Trascott's cheery laugh was the only answer.

"In England," the lawyer mused, "I would
give them six weeks.  In this southern climate,
where the blood runs hot, the climax must come
in less time, but just how long only Britton knows."

Trascott tapped his pipe upon the pier,
refilled it and settled back with a sigh.

"Do you think this affair is really serious?"
he asked, with a certain earnestness and anxiety.

"Serious!" Ainsworth snorted, "it's the most
serious thing that ever happened him.  Do you
understand Britton's disposition?  He's a
whole-hearted fellow full of generous and chivalric
impulses, with a belief in the goodness of all the
feminine sex.  He has run against nothing to
knock those notions into chaos.  Do you think
he can view that fine-looking woman unmoved?
Do you think that she is going to pass by Reginald
Britton, the heir to Britton Hall and old
Oliver's estates?  Not if I know anything,
Trascott!  And mark me, I don't like the woman.
She's fair enough for a lord–but I don't like
her.  Please remember that, Trascott."

The curate started, for he had earlier confessed
to himself a similar dislike of the blonde beauty
who had taken the yacht and Britton and the
port itself, as well as the great English hotels,
by storm.  However, he was too fair-minded not
to combat such an antipathy so far unwarranted.

"Why do you not like her?" he asked, seeking
perhaps in Ainsworth's attitude a solution of his
own state of mind.

"Intuition, I suppose," the lawyer answered
gruffly.  "When I see a lady travelling alone,
except for her maid, coming apparently from
nowhere and heading for a destination wholly
indefinite, I always regard her with suspicion.
What has Britton learned about this woman?
He knows her name is Maud Morris.  He knows
she can madden him with those eyes and lips.
That is the extent of his knowledge.  Does he
know her home, her county, her family, her
support?  No!  I have questioned Britton, not
to mention warning him–"

"You have!" exclaimed the curate, "and what
did he say?"

"Told me to go to that infernal region I
mentioned.  He can't listen to sound reason.  They
never can!"

"Ah, well," sighed Trascott, "I intended
dropping a hint, but since you've anticipated me
without result–"

"Might as well talk to a log!" Ainsworth
cut in.  "I shall be glad when the thing has run
its course and we get out of here.  This Algerian
scenery palls on me!  If something would only
happen to hasten the climax, it might cheer my
heart.  I believe I shall hire some dogs of Arabs
to abduct the fair princess and let Britton play
the rescuer somewhere out on the Djujuras."

"It may not be necessary," said Trascott.
"He's going to that dance to-night."

"Yes," muttered the lawyer, "he's been dressing
and fussing ever since supper.  There's the
launch now!"

The gasoline craft spluttered and danced over
the waves to the pier where Ainsworth and the
curate were smoking.

"You lazy duffers," Britton cried, "aren't you
going up?"

He stepped out of the launch, a tall, handsome
figure in his evening clothes and top-hat.  His
paletot hung on his left arm, which was now
entirely well, and as he faced his friends they both
thought how singularly powerful he looked.
Broad of shoulder and deep of chest, it seemed
as if the frames of the other two men together
would have been required to equal his bulk.  His
straight, finely-cut features and blue eyes held an
expression unmistakably aristocratic.

"Aren't you going up?" he repeated.

"We'll look into the reading-room later on,"
replied Ainsworth.  "I don't care to dance, and
it disagrees with Trascott's digestion."

"See you there, then," was his farewell.
"Don't forget you can get all you want to eat
in the dining-room for the sum of six francs."

A *fiacre* pulled up near the wharf at his hail.

"Hotel de ––," he said, jumping in with an
object-lesson of alacrity.

The driver accepted the hint and dashed away
at a swift pace through the lower town till the
long ascent which led up to Mustapha Supérieure
compelled him to walk his animal.

The last two weeks had passed for Rex Britton
as a single day.  Not a minute of the whole time
dragged, for the reason that he had spent every
available minute with Maud Morris.  He
considered the sojourn, which he had lengthened
day by day, as Paradise–the direct antithesis,
in fact, of Ainsworth's view!  He had pursued
the wild dream of that first night on the harbor
with all his passionate persistence till it suddenly
ensnared him in its tangible and compelling
reality.

The lawyer back on the pier was wishing for
something to hasten the climax.  In spite of his
faculty of shrewd observation, Ainsworth did not
dream of how deeply Britton was already
involved with the woman whom he, Ainsworth,
mistrusted.

It would take a wise man indeed to time and
trace the development of a romance when the
setting lies between the pagan Djujuras and the
legend-steeped Mediterranean.  Britton would
have been filled with dismay had he stopped to
inspect, analyze and adjudge his actions during
those two weeks.  His impulses were at riot
under the sway of a heavenly elixir which the
woman held to his lips; he never looked back; his
mind was centred on the days ahead, planning
a wonderful permanency for the exotic, filmy
atmosphere of present experiences.

As the *fiacre* climbed the Mustapha Supérieure
Britton could possess in vision the whole
expanse of the port, the wharves dimly lighted
and busy with the night-labor that the volume
of trade enforced, the illuminated vessels in the
wide anchorage and the mingling gleams that
marked the Mustapha Inférieure.

Britton knew every nook of the climbing city,
old, by almost a thousand years, in story and
conflict.  With the lady of pale-gold beauty he
had explored all the charming retreats of both
towns.  They had loitered in the Place Royale
amid the orange and lime trees, finding pleasure
in watching the cosmopolitan crowds which
thronged that oblong space in the centre of the
city.  The traits of character disclosed by
representatives of so many different nations–Moors,
Jews and Arabs, Germans, Spaniards, French,
Corsicans, Italians and Maltese, and scores of
other races–proved very interesting to the
English observers.

The mild, balmy Algerian evenings seemed
temptations to roam abroad, and the two had
grown accustomed to promenade the Bab-el-Ouad
and the Bab-azoun, which ran north and south
in a parallel direction for half a mile.  Those
walks down the dim vista of flanking colonnades
beneath an ivory moon, the same that lighted the
Sahara caravans through the desert tracts,
intoxicated senses and blood alike.

They had delved into the *djamas*, or superior
mosques, the *mesjids*, or inferior ones, and the
*marabouts*, which were the tombs or sanctuaries
of the ancient Moorish saints; they had plunged
into the market rabbles on the Squares de
Chartres, d'Isly and Mahon, lolled in the Parisian-like
boulevards and arcades of the new town, sat
upon the flat-roofed, prison-windowed houses at
sunset to catch the tang of the sweeping sea-wind
on their faces, journeyed in the yacht as far as
the lighthouse on Cape Matifou and the
forbidding brow of Cape Caxine, or stretched their
land-legs in the ascent of the narrow, jagged
street called the Casbah that led up to the old
Moorish fortress of the same name perched high
on the steep, and commanding all Algiers.

Standing on the height of the Mustapha
Supérieure where the *fiacre* had left him in front of
the hotel piazza, Britton felt as if under some
binding spell which the land of the sheik had
cast upon him, a spell from which he would not
willingly escape, for the delicious, cobwebby
fetters only thrilled instead of chafing.

Dismissing his driver with a liberal fee,
Britton ran lightly up the steps of the magnificent
hostelry, resplendent with blazing lights and
ornate structural patterns designed to rival the
architectural beauties of the other fashionable
resorts that contested for the patronage of the
most select people who came to stay at Algiers.

The obsequious concierge, stationed in the hall
to look after new-comers, directed a servant to
appropriate Britton's coat and hat and bowed the
Englishman toward the reception-room with a
flood of welcoming French.

The reception-room–which some took the
liberty of calling the morning-room–was a cosy,
oak-panelled, damask-hung chamber where hotel
inmates and visitors could meet or wait for
friends.  It gave one the impression of being very
well appointed with rugs, round tables,
leather-covered chairs, cushioned divans, pictures,
mantels and window-seats.

At Britton's entrance the solitary occupant of
the reception-room rose from a divan.  She came
forward with a glad, excited light beautifying
her face, the filmy, silver-colored gown she wore
sweeping gracefully about her slim, exquisite figure.

Quite close to Britton she paused and took hold
of the lapels of his coat, smoothing them with
her soft white fingers.

Had the lawyer been there to see, this action
would have settled once for all the question of
Britton's relation to Maud Morris.  In her
movement was the suggestion of intimate possession
never to be mistaken for anything else.  It told
more than could be expressed in whole chapters
of explanation.

"The dance has begun," she murmured, looking
up, her eyes soft and shining beneath the
burnished gold of her hair, "and everybody has gone
either to take part or to watch.  You are
somewhat late, aren't you?"

"Yes, I am late," Britton said softly–"later
than I thought, but I am glad, for my tardiness
lets me meet you like this!"  He nodded around
the empty room.

She smiled into Britton's dancing eyes.  He
laid his hands gently upon hers, and the touch
brought the delicate rose to her cheek, but the
concierge's rapid French jabber warned them.
Someone was approaching the reception-room.
She slipped a hand in Britton's arm and turned
to the door.

"Let us go to the concert-room," she said simply.

Britton bowed courteously as an attaché from
the British Consulate entered with a party of
ladies, and they went out amid the customary
admiring stares.

They passed the rooms whence came the rattle
of ping-pong, the whirr of billiards or the almost
noiseless shuffle of bridge, and finally came to the
ballroom.  A ravishing Hungarian waltz swelled
up from the palm screens which hid the orchestra;
a hundred couples tripped the glassy floor-space,
the conventional black-and-white attire of the
gentlemen lending an effective contrast to the
wonderful, daring toilettes of the ladies.

Everybody portrayed supreme happiness as
well as a nice consciousness of what was correct,
and everybody seemed to be trying to outdo
everyone else in the ardor of enjoyment.

Not least by any means among the joy-seekers
was Rex Britton.

His arm encircled his companion's waist and
they stepped out, the handsomest couple in the
room, swaying a second to the time of the
orchestra.  Then they glided away, captivated by the
pulsating strains of the waltz, and lost themselves
in the maze.

   CHAPTER III.

Ainsworth shook his billiard-cue with
unmistakable emphasis in the stranger's face.

"Get out," he cried irascibly.  "You're drunk,
and I don't want to talk to you!"  He pushed
his annoyer rudely away, but the latter returned
to the attack, whereupon Bertrand Trascott intervened.

"Have patience, Cyril," he begged.  "The man
evidently has a reason for his persistence.  Now,
sir, what is it?  We would like to go on with our
game."

The stranger who had circled in to the corner-table
in the billiard-room of the great hotel and
stopped their play presented an uninviting and
ludicrous appearance.

His head and shoulders reminded Trascott of
those of a dissipated Austrian virtuoso whom he
knew well and whose brilliance had become very
spasmodic on account of relapses to the same vice
which apparently ruled the stranger.  The
resemblance was quite close, embodying the
uncontrolled, tremulous chin and lips surmounted by
a fiercely-curled wisp of moustache, the hawked
nose, narrowed eyes and prominent, bony cheeks,
with a pair of puttied ears sprouting from his
hair like old mushrooms in the grass, while a
pinched, sunken neck failed to fill his peaked
shoulders.

Trascott thought that if both the Austrian
virtuoso and the portly butler who had come to be
looked on as an institution at Britton Hall were
cut in two, and the upper half of the virtuoso
pieced to the lower, corpulent section of the
Honorable Oliver's servant the result would be
the prototype of the stranger who had
undertaken to tack among the billiard-tables.

"What do you want?" he asked the man, with
more severity.

The questioned one surveyed Trascott for a
space, recognized his curate's cloth and decided
he had no business with him, for his eyes flashed
aggressively upon the lawyer, who was again
preparing for the execution of the stroke that the
man had spoiled.

Ainsworth's back was turned, so the intruder
jogged his right elbow for attention with the
result that the lawyer's ball, deflected at right
angles, leaped across the next table and spread
confusion among a group of Frenchmen playing
there.

This second interruption of the stringing of a
long break and the titter of idle observers,
combined with the French stares of contempt, was
not at all conducive to the regaining of
Ainsworth's equanimity.

"By gad, sir, get out of here," he admonished,
"or I'll very soon have the concierge throw you out!"

"You?" asked the stranger, with a belligerent glare.

"Exactly!" Ainsworth answered emphatically.
He looked as if he would quite gladly
exempt the concierge from consideration and
perform the operation himself.

Trascott had been roaming the room in search
of an hotel servant who could lead this obstinate
fellow away; there being none about, however, he
compromised on a marker and returned to the
intruder.

He still concentrated his attention on the
lawyer with that same belligerent glare, though
in his eyes a rising flicker of apprehension
betrayed the inward reflection that he had somehow
caught a Tartar in this smooth-faced, perfectly-fed
man with coat off and billiard-cue in hand.

"You're Britton?" he inquired in a thick,
heavy voice.

"I'm nothing of the sort," the irate lawyer returned.

The stranger took a step nearer and leaned his
hip against the billiard-table.

"You deny it?" he snarled vindictively.  "The
assistant concierge informed me that you were
Britton."

Ainsworth flourished the cue in his hand suggestively.

"Then the assistant concierge is an ass, like
yourself," he said.  "There are two of you, and
this hotel is no place for such a team."

Trascott pushed forward the marker he had
procured.

"Come, monsieur," said the marker.  "I think
there are better places than this for you."

The stranger whirled and savagely struck away
the persuading fingers with which the polite
Frenchman had grasped his arm.

"Look out for yourself," he stormed, "or I'll
have the manager pack you off to-morrow, my
fine fellow.  Let me tell you that you can't turn
men of my standing into the street.  I have
engaged rooms and paid for them in advance, and
I'll go where I d–d please in this hotel–and
do what I please also!"

"No, you won't, my friend," warned Ainsworth,
tapping him on the shoulder with quiet
determination.  "You won't come in here twice to
insult me and interrupt my play.  Just keep
that in your muddled mind!"

"I was informed that you were a certain
Britton I was searching for," said the other
bluntly, in the spirit of rude apology.

"Do I look like Britton?" cried the lawyer,
testily.  "I stand five feet six, while Britton
stands six feet one.  I weigh one hundred and
fifty pounds; Britton weighs two hundred and
ten.  Britton dances in the ballroom with the
ladies and brings them ices, but I play billiards
with a curate.  I ask you again, do I resemble
him?  No, you say.  And I'll tell you something
else, too!  Britton wouldn't have suffered your
impudence for this length of time.  He's a
quick-blooded beggar, and he'd have jolly well twisted
your neck by now."

"Will you come out, sir?" begged the marker,
making a second attempt, at the importunations
of Trascott.

The stranger eyed him and raised a hand as if
to strike, then diverted the hand to his waistcoat
pocket and threw his card on the table.

"Take that card to the manager as my
complaint, and tell him to dismiss you," he said,
somewhat haughtily.  "I'm Christopher Morris,
promoter of the Yukon Dredging Company."

The servant took the pasteboard, a little awed.
Ainsworth had not caught the stranger's
surname, but he snapped at the mention of his
especial enterprise.

"The Yukon Dredging Company!" he
exclaimed suspiciously.  "If you are the promoter
of that scheme, I warn you to watch out for me.
I'm Ainsworth, the law-machine, and I'm
convinced that the Dredging Company is a mere
swindle.  Be careful!  I'll put the Crown after
you at the very first opportunity."

The object of his censure sniffed in scorn, but
Ainsworth continued:

"You invited my antagonism.  Now perhaps
you'll regret it.  If anything angers me, it is the
loss of my self-respect, and those Frenchmen took
me for an idiot.  But you sound decidedly out of
place next the Sahara, my friend.  You should
be at the Arctic end of a different continent.
What are you hunting in Algiers–floating capital?"

"No," was the answer.  "I am hunting my
wife.  I arrived but an hour ago from Tangier,
where the cursed doctors quarantined me for a
chill which they insisted on calling fever.  When
after twenty days' hammering at their thick
heads I convinced them of their mistake, they let
me out, and I found my wife had hurried away to
escape infection."  He laughed, and with a cold,
indignant significance intensifying his words,
repeated: "Hurried away to escape infection!"

"Your wife," echoed the puzzled lawyer.
"What has that to do with your offensive
attitude?  What has that to do with Rex Britton?"

"They tell me that in finding Britton I shall
find my wife!"

Understanding rushed upon Ainsworth, and
he, as well as Trascott, was stirred to fiery
excitement.  He shook the man roughly by the shoulder.
"Your name?" he breathlessly demanded.
"What did you say was your name?"

"Morris–Christopher Morris," was the
answer.  "My wife's name is Maud, and the devil
gave her the prettiest face in England."

Ainsworth passed his hand across his forehead.
His face held the first expression of dismay that
the curate had ever seen there.  To Trascott it
was evident that the lawyer's unconcealed
mistrust of the woman concerned had not extended
to such an unforeseen contingency as now existed
upon the statement of Morris.

The barrister was not looking at the curate
and could not see the accompanying signs of
extreme agitation in the latter's countenance.  The
former seemed to be weighing a doubtful point in
his mind, and when he spoke it was as to himself
in a musing, philosophical manner.

"This is either a drunken hallucination,
insanity, or the truth," he said, softly.  "Let us
have a test!"  He dropped a vesta match upon
the green baize of the table.

"Pick that up," he said to Morris.

The man stared an instant and obeyed.  Ainsworth
watched him closely.  His fingers went
down with disconcerting steadiness, closed
unerringly over the match and returned it to the
barrister.  The latter raised appealing eyes to his
friend and said:

"He drinks, but he is not overly drunk now.
I'm afraid it is the truth."

Trascott, his earnest face all troubled and his
lips compressed in a grim line, shook his head.

"This is something like what I feared," he
groaned.





.. vspace:: 4

.. class:: center large

   CHAPTER IV.

.. vspace:: 2

Morris mumbled something of repeated apology
and made a movement to leave the room.

Ainsworth stopped him.

"I'll find Britton," he said.  "This mess has
to be straightened out, and it wouldn't do for
you to wander round till you meet him and raise
Cain before a lot of women.  I'll bring him here
in a minute."

"You're kind," grunted the other, sarcastically,
"but I'll wait for you."

The lawyer hastened out, peering into the
different rooms in search of the man he wanted.
He suspected that he would find the woman with
Britton, and as he sought, unheeding acquaintances
or greetings, he came upon the couple in
the dining-room.

They were standing at the buffet, chatting and
laughing and partaking of the six-franc supper
which Britton had mentioned to his friends.  The
dining-hall was full, and Ainsworth hesitated at
the door.  He had a peculiar and intense hatred
of scenes, and he knew that this company,
consisting partly of bored aristocracy and partly of
different gradings of the vulgar rich, was ready
to stare and laugh at an unconventional act, as,
for instance, the interruption of someone's
luncheon.

Britton espied him at the door, and cut short
his vacillation by beckoning him over, making
room for him at the same time.  Ainsworth
approached them grimly.

"Have you not had lunch?" Britton inquired
cheerily.  "Come, there's room here.  We'll
wait for you."

"I couldn't eat a bite," said the lawyer,
truthfully.  "I wanted to speak to you for a moment,
if you're through.  That's all."

He avoided the eyes of Maud Morris and did
not attempt to address her directly.

"There's the after-lunch dance, you know,"
objected Britton.  "It's a matter of etiquette
with these people."

"Can't you let it go?" asked the lawyer,
sharply.

His tone awakened his friend's scrutiny.
"What's the matter?" he asked.  "How long do
you want me?"

"It may be some time," answered Ainsworth.
"I wish you would come immediately."

Maud Morris smiled full upon the lawyer and
forced him to meet her glorious eyes.

"Just one round," she pleaded prettily, with a
nod towards the ballroom.

At that moment Ainsworth was transformed,
in his own mind, into the grim master of life.
The other two were the trifling, wayward
children to whom chastisement would presently
come.  It did not matter if, in their ignorance,
they coveted those few turns together; they
could have their gambols just on the eve of
disillusionment!  It might help the cure of
Britton's malady when Ainsworth would afterwards
remind him of the incident.

"By all means," he said sarcastically.  "It
will satisfy these sticklers."

They swept merrily into the adjacent
ballroom, and Ainsworth followed as far as the
entrance.  The occasion struck him with a
certain grim humor, and he chuckled silently as he
stood in the alcove watching the couple circling
to the orchestra's music.

They floated slowly, as in a delightful dream,
round the immense and gorgeously-decorated
salon, the woman looking upward ecstatically,
with her face aquiver with light, and whispering
with both lips and eyes.  Britton, oblivious to
the irony of the situation, had forgotten even
Ainsworth.  He was plunged in the joy of the
moment, and the watching lawyer could imagine
what words he was murmuring in the meshes of
her hair.

Then, in the midst of his ironical judgment, a
pang of something nearly akin to pity moved
Ainsworth.  For an instant he debated with
himself the issue if this amour should prove genuine
on both sides, but the thought was immediately
dismissed by his cynical reasoning as improbable.
The man was in earnest, but the woman was a
siren, in Ainsworth's critical view.

One round of the ballroom floor was all the
enjoyment they allowed themselves, for the
lawyer significantly stepped out when they reached
the entrance curtains.  Britton looked at him
vaguely and contracted his brows in a half-frown
when he remembered.

He led the lady to a settee and bent over her
for a moment.

"You will come back soon?" she whispered
with a shade of wistfulness.

Britton pressed her fingers on her fan under
pretence of examining it.

"Yes," he promised, glorying in the depths of
her eyes, "I'll come back, not soon, but at once.
Our dance isn't finished, you know."

He strode across the room, tall and elegant,
and smiling over his shoulder so that the
woman's heart leaped oddly as she watched him.

"Now, Ainsworth," he said, laying a hand on
his comrade's arm, "what do you want with me?
You'll please hurry, won't you?"

The lawyer drew Britton's arm tightly through
his own and turned across the main promenade.

"That woman's married," he said with brutal
directness, "and I'm taking you to her husband."

Britton whipped out his arm from Ainsworth's
grasp and held it upraised, as if to deliver a
blow, while a red wave of denunciation flamed
over his fine features.

"You–" he began, and halted, for the grim,
set look in his companion's eyes carried
undeniable conviction.

"Strike me if you like," Ainsworth observed
harshly, "but come this way with me."

Britton's fist fell to his side, and he drew his
whole frame rigidly erect in a sort of convulsive
movement.  In spite of his great strength he
staggered a little, and his face was ashy-white.

He turned irresolutely back towards the entrance
of the dancing salon, but Ainsworth took
his arm again.

"No, this way," he urged, and led him as he
would a boy.

People marked his rigid muscles and pallid
skin, and murmured compassionately at the
apparent stroke of illness.

"Hello, old chap!" cried one of his numerous
acquaintances, shouldering up, "what's wrong?
Heat too much for you?  By Jove, you're in a
beastly funk, and I don't wonder, for it's deuced
close in here."

The lawyer waved him aside, and they went on,
while all the guests began to complain of heat,
and the assiduous concierge ran to open wider
the French casements on the lawns.

Once or twice Ainsworth looked up at his
companion.  Britton's pallor and tremendous calm,
so suggestive of the latent volcanic powers,
alarmed the lawyer.

"How do you feel?" he whispered sympathetically.

"I feel nothing–absolutely nothing,"
responded Britton, in a dull, passionless tone, and
Ainsworth did not doubt him for a moment.

"Where is your man?" he asked after a second,
in the same listless and unimpassioned voice.

"Here, in this room," Ainsworth answered,
entering the billiard parlors.  They skirted the
tables and came where Morris stood with Trascott.

"Here is the man Morris," he announced in a
measured manner.  "Morris, this is Britton."

As Ainsworth spoke, he braced himself to
guard against a hundred ugly possibilities which
this meeting presented.  He scanned the
lineaments of the two men, alert to catch the nerve
purpose dependent upon each one's expression,
and in thus studying the features of Morris he
lost sight of the latter's hands, which were thrust
loosely in the pockets of his coat.

The husband's narrow eyes glittered; his lips
were drawn back over his teeth in a wolfish
snarl; all his capability for extreme hate seemed
to be given free scope as he centred ferocious
glances on the stony countenance of Rex Britton.

The other occupants of the room instinctively
felt that the atmosphere held some vital and
dramatic portent.  They stopped their play and
gazed wonderingly on the group over by the
corner table.

There the two principal figures glared at each
other without uttering a word, the one standing
upright with set face and folded arms, the other
crouching like a beast ready to spring in rage.

Ainsworth had never felt such a tense moment,
even in his pleadings before tightly-packed courts
of law.  He was involuntarily forced to hold his
breath in suspense, and a band of steel seemed
to rim his chest.  Trascott, with his habitual,
comforting sanity, offered no speech.  He
recognized arbitration to be as futile as it was
inconceivable.  Things must run their course.  Only
he was ready, like Ainsworth, to guard against
deadly violence following the outbreak.

For some moments Morris crouched and glared,
a malicious quiver running through him.  Then
if any of the men had watched where his right
hand was hidden they might have seen the cloth
of the pocket poked forward by something
cylindrical inside.

A stunning report, coming apparently from
nowhere, shook the windows.  Britton reeled, as
a tuft of hair floated off from above his temple,
and jumped like the recoil of a spring upon his
would-be murderer.  He dealt two sharp, quick
blows before the weapon could be pulled again,
and the thing was all over.

Morris lay in a quiet heap, with threads of
white smoke drifting up from the powder-blackened
hole in his pocket.

Britton rubbed the red welt along his scalp
and nodded gravely to Ainsworth.

"You're my counsel in this matter, of course,"
he said.  "Attend to whatever explanations are
needed!  Trascott, will you come with me?"

They elbowed out through the motley, clamorous,
ever-increasing crowd that the pistol-shot
had gathered.

"What do you mean to do?" asked the curate,
anxiously.

"The hardest thing I ever did," Britton answered
pitifully.  "I want you, because I doubt
if I can do it alone.  I'm afraid of myself, Trascott!"

   CHAPTER V.

They sought the concierge and met him, all
flustered, coming out of the office by the side
entrance on his way to the room of tumult which
they had just quitted.  Britton added to his
cares by despatching him with a message to Maud
Morris in the ballroom.

"Tell Mrs. Morris that I am waiting in her
drawing-room," he said.  "Ask her if she will
take the elevator at once and see me on an
important matter."

The concierge made expressive gestures with
his hands.

"Not Madame Morris," he suggested, somewhat
puzzled.  "Monsieur means Mademoiselle!"

"Ah! yes, of course," returned the Englishman,
quickly, "A mere slip of the tongue!  My
message is for Mademoiselle, for Miss Morris.
You will find her on that large settee just at the
entrance of the salon."

He smiled grimly at the precise classification
which to-morrow would be of a different value.
The ghost of the smile lingered on his lips, as,
disdaining the lift, he pulled Trascott towards
the stairs.

"Let us walk up," he begged.  "It will give
me time to think."

Trascott moved beside him automatically and
left Britton to his own reflections.  That, he
thought, was undoubtedly the surest way to victory.

Their ascent was slow and silent, their footfalls
deadening to an odd, mysterious void on the
thickly-padded steps.  The mounting sensation,
the absence of noise from his movements, seemed
to lift Britton away from himself.  His personality
was effaced, in the physical sense, and the
basic impulses which influenced his course of
existence lay bared before an inner tribunal.

The vaster issue remained with him; the moral
measure applied to his strength alone; the
portentous effects of the next few minutes would be
essentially moulded at the dictum of his
emotional tendencies.  The present exigency could
be neither flouted nor shunned.  This difficulty
of another's evolving, augmented in no small
measure by his own unseeing folly, demanded
immediate and decisive solution.  Apology was
cowardice and parley an affront to Britton's
frank fibre, and both of them smacked of guilt.

The suite of rooms taken by Maud Morris was
situated on the first floor just to the right of the
public hall, near the landing.  She had at her
disposal a luxurious drawing-room, a more
luxurious boudoir, and bath and sleeping apartments.

Trascott stopped at the stair-head and folded
his arms, signifying his exclusion from the
approaching developments.

"I don't think you will have any need of me,"
he ventured reassuringly.

Britton vouchsafed no reply.  The swift
momentary reaction he experienced did not disturb
the hard, emotionless mask of his features, and
the sudden, peculiarly human revolt stirred by
his unsatisfied heart-hunger was crushed with a
tremendous summoning of will-power.

He swiftly traversed the corridor and entered
the drawing-room.

It was empty, and a poignant chagrin struck
Britton, inflicting pain scarcely definable from
that of humiliation and disgrace, as he realized
that perhaps Maud Morris, detecting impending
exposure, had suddenly clutched seclusion as a
safeguard with that wanton spirit and careless
indifference of the time-hardened trifler.

But Britton was wrong in this thought!

While he paced a few steps in indecision, the
boudoir curtains parted, and through the soft,
shaded illumination of the room Maud Morris
looked out at him.

"I am waiting for you," she called, with a
tremulous smile which indicated the fluttering
state of her feelings, yet left the origin of that
uncertainty in doubt.

If it was a bait, Britton snapped like a deluded
fish.  The sudden presentation of the less
disagreeable side of the situation weakened his
guard.  He acted before he reflected, and stepped
forward into the boudoir.

The tapestry fell in place behind him, and with
its silken swish Britton felt the error he had
unthinkingly committed.  This boudoir, which
enthralled with its essentially feminine
appointments, was the worst place in the world for
rallying stern resolutions and formulating
all-embracing decisions such as Britton proposed to
make.  The place could only shake his sincere
purpose.  The drawing-room, in graver setting,
would have been far safer for him!

He put a rigid curb upon his impulses, and
attempted to shut out the powerful charm of
low-burning rose lights, Bohemian color, and
lavish decoration, but a stronger influence than
these laid its hold upon him, that delicate,
indefinable, alluring fragrance which is found only
within woman's precincts, and which attracts
mightily, like woman's love, because of its tender,
subtle elusiveness.

Then, more compelling than the sense-conquering
color-effect, more entrancing than the
pervading perfume, was the magic of Maud Morris
herself.  To Britton's mind, in moments wholly
calm and lucid, he thought he had never seen
perfections of face and form which approached
hers.  Such beauty as she possessed was
technically matchless, but, in general, there are
intervals when fascination flags and any existing
flaws in the object of admiration force attention.

When Britton was cursed with these critical
flashes, as he was accustomed to inwardly
express it, he could detect a lack of something–it
might have been soul–behind the level splendor
of her blue eyes, but if he tried to fathom these
depths and define this missing attribute, the
mere outward splendor, like the crystal sheen of
deep, clear water, was dazzling enough to make
him dizzy and engulf him, and the effort at
introspection went unrewarded.

So Britton stood wrestling with the spell of
environment, hurling mental refusals upon the
suggestive enticement of the boudoir atmosphere
and battling against the magical allurement of
the woman who was the climax in the dainty
sphere of exotic loveliness.

She seemed framed in the shell of the room
as if it had been especially designed to harmonize
with her charms.  Her pale, silver-colored gown
swept about her feet, leaving her figure in a
contour of marvellous grace; the arms and bosom,
full and rounded, came out from it, white as
ivory; her face, beautiful as a rare orchid, with
the crowning glory of her hair above, was one to
weaken a strong man.

Harassed by a flood of doubts and regrets,
Britton gazed at her with wide, darkened eyes,
the shame of his position vying in torture with
the pang of his loss.  He had come to judge, to
condemn and to scorn, but his capacity for this
was submerged in painful realization of the black
void of the future through which he must walk.

Maud Morris recognized the facing of a crisis
in his attitude, and she nervously clasped her
slim fingers as she read something of what was
passing in his mind.

"Rex, you know!" she cried, with a sort of
of awed inspiration tinged by an inflection of fear.

"Yes, I know," he answered despairingly.  "I
know everything!  God help me–and you!"

There was no reproach in his words, rather a
prayer.  The thing before him was too beautiful
to curse.  He had plainly misjudged his strength
and underrated his task.  The animated presence
of her he loved filled both his physical and mental
vision with impressionistic power.  The passion
which he thought had died at the instant of
Ainsworth's announcement grew in magnitude as a
spring torrent grows with a rush of sorrowful
rain.  It mastered him, crushed his scorn and
turned condemnation upon his own head.  To
the great credit of Britton's manlier qualities a
phase of unconscious heroism ruled as the
foremost factor in his new solution of the problem.

"Good-bye," he said with a near approach to
kindness, "and forgive me if you can.  I think
I am the one to blame."

He held out his hand before turning to leave
the boudoir.  Maud Morris snatched it rather
than took it, apprehension in her eyes.

"Good-bye, Rex?" she whispered.  "You can't
go from me.  Think of how we've cared.  Think
of the invisible ties."

Britton's mouth hardened, showing his disgust.
Her speech came nearer rousing him to voluble
contempt than any inherent feeling.

"Ties!" he exclaimed severely.  "Ignominy
upon a marriage bond is no tie.  It is rather a
matter of expiation!"

His words had the intonation of farewell, and
he laid one hand on the portières, but Maud
Morris rushed forward with a cry, holding him
with a passionate caress which was either the
height of consummate acting or the essence of
mad desire.

Her touch thrilled Britton for one vivid,
insane moment, and he stood like a man in a dream
listening to her vociferous pleading.

"Take me with you!" she cried.  "Biskra is
two days by rail, Sidi Okba two hours more by
carriage–then the desert!  The Sahara, Rex, do
you hear?  No one shall ever find us!"

Britton's brain swung slowly back through
bewilderment at the mention of detail, and he
stared at her with a gradual horror growing in
his eyes as his idol ground itself to dust.

"The desert, dear,–and oblivion," she murmured again.

A hundred scenes flashed before his sight.  One
stood out–the picture of Trascott waiting for
him, his fine face plunged in anxiety and a strong
prayer in his generous heart.  This psychic
vision completed Britton's revulsion, and he
violently pushed the woman away.

"The desert–and hell for us both!" he fiercely
cried.  "Let me get out of this!"

In that moment of repulse Maud Morris
assumed her true character, and Britton read
behind her eyes for the first time.  She did not
lack a soul; the soul leaped out at him, but it
was as the advance of a serpent, malignant and
revengeful.  Her beauty lost itself in a hard,
bright mask of undistinctive flesh and eyes.

"If you go, I'll ruin you!" she warned, in a
voice hoarse with jealous fury.  "I'll spoil you
for the dear eligibles from one end of England to
the other!"

Britton gazed at her transformation before
answering, and wondered why he had loved her.

"Your husband will do that," he said at last.
"I hardly expect to keep out of court."

"Reflect!" she said harshly.  "He cannot do
it as I can."

The knots of the portière cords would not yield
to Britton's pull, and he tore the silken curtains
down in a heap upon the floor.  Their clinging
folds seemed symbolic of their siren-like owner,
and the man shuddered as he dropped them from
his fingers.

"You will not reflect?"

"The enormity of your proposal precludes
reflection," said Britton, witheringly.

"It's war then?" Her tone was steely.

"It's war, if you put it that way," he wearily
responded; "but hadn't you better spare your
own name?"

She laughed shortly.

"Mine will not count," she said mockingly.
"The public will sympathize with the deluded
wife.  While holding me blameless, English
society will haul your reputation over the
cobblestones till there isn't a shred of it left."

Britton regarded her silently for a long,
comprehensive minute, and went swiftly out of the
boudoir.  She followed, still reluctant to give
up the battle.

"There is another consideration–the attitude
of the Honorable Oliver Britton in this disgrace,"
she said, using the last and most cruel weapon
of all.  "Do you know what your uncle will do?
If you don't, I can tell you!"

Britton paled perceptibly, as he met the battery
of her eyes, upon the drawing-room threshold.
He made a denunciatory wave of his hand and
closed the door sharply.

Trascott had no words.  He gave Britton a
fervent finger-clasp and a bright smile of relief
and thankfulness.  No elation he had ever felt
at the rescuing of some poor wretch from the
English slums compared with his joy at Britton's
personal victory.

They used the elevator.  At the bottom of the
lift, Ainsworth waited beside a servant who held
their coats and hats.

"Well, what is it?" questioned Britton, earnestly.

"He says it's law, as soon as they reach home,"
replied Ainsworth, grimly.  "Have you any
thought of cruising in other parts?"

Retreat was repugnant to a strong man like
Britton.  He shook his head decidedly.

In fifteen minutes they had reached the wharf
and boarded the *Mottisfont*.  She rode at a
single anchor chain, and twin coils of grayish
smoke issued from her double funnels.

It was the second watch, and the mate held the
bridge.  Britton called to him.

"Have you a head of steam?"

"Plenty, sir," the mate replied.

"Then weigh your anchor!"

"Aye, aye, sir.  Where away?"

"Home to New Shoreham!"

   CHAPTER VI.

.. vspace:: 2

The case of Morris *versus* Britton, as developed
in the judicial courts, was one of those neurotic
society flurries that never fail to arouse interest
and promote discussion from highland to sea-down.

Complete details of all legal proceedings,
together with copious comment on the demeanor of
complainant and defendant, as well as irrelevant
addenda concerning such things as dress and
facial expression, can be found in the back files
of a certain aristocratic journal, but nothing
edifying is to be gained by perusal of this
voluminous report.  The circulation of the sheet in
question was given sudden and tremendous
impetus, yet this proved merely temporary, for the
revengeful note obtruded, the personal animosity
broke forth, overstepping all limits of honor and
fair play, so that those who had not heretofore
followed public topics over-closely wondered
what was the editor's quarrel with the defendant.
But his quarrel was not with the nephew;
although through the nephew he hoped to reach
the uncle, the Honorable Oliver Britton, who was
abroad, representing England in a consular
capacity.

The name of Britton, of Britton Hall, was high
enough and proud enough and old enough to
afford a splendid target for the batteries of
ignominy which were masked within the
publishing offices of the warring journal, and the
fact that the Honorable Oliver Britton had once
humbled by personal opposition the political
aspirations of the editor was what made the
reputation-shelling process so destructive.  Still, in
spite of the deliberate use of his heaviest
artillery, the man behind the fire of words did not
foresee the startling result of such drastic
measures.

When, after months of fighting through
successive law-courts, the celebrated action came to
an end, the journal's editor had to announce,
much to his chagrin, that the final verdict was
dismissal with a division of costs.  This decision,
the report intimated, was due entirely to that
matchless legal machine, Ainsworth.

However, the enemy of the Britton name
enjoyed the satisfaction of knowing that his
vitriolic pen had done more than he dared to
hope, for he soon had the supreme delight of
stating that, owing to the disgrace involving the
family name, the Honorable Oliver Britton had
resigned his post as Consul at a foreign court.
Furthermore, the powers that appoint had placed
another in the post in the diplomatic service
which, it was understood, was being reserved for
Rex Britton till his return from the holiday
cruise that his honor-graduation at Oxford had
earned.

And, later, the journal announced what it had
not foreseen, the news that the Honorable Oliver
Britton had returned from the Continent,
violently quarrelled with his nephew and
disinherited him.  It gloated over the cruel truth that
of all the Brittons, who had for generations
counted thousands of pounds upon their
rent-rolls, a Britton now stood penniless, except for
a paltry three hundred guineas left out of his
patrimony, nearly exhausted by the long legal
battle; gloated over him because the gentleman's
hand must turn to labor, the ambitious trusts of
educational and diplomatic posts being denied
him on account of the name-smudge.

There the journal's report and comment ends,
except for an item telling that Christopher
Morris and his wife had gone to America.

The night Rex Britton quarrelled with his
uncle, he went out from Britton Hall, down
white gravel walks between clipped hedges,
under the massed oaks in the familiar grove, and
along green Sussex lanes to the depot.  There he
telegraphed Ainsworth to get Trascott to meet
him at the former's rooms, as new developments
had arisen which occasioned his departure from
what he had considered home since his boyhood
days.  The night express took him up and
whirled him away to London.

Trascott was with a dying woman in the slums,
so it was evening of the next day before the three
friends could get together in Cyril Ainsworth's
rooms.  The curate came in, weary and
depressed, and with a gravity of bearing caused by
association with the near presence of death.

"The uncle has cut the nephew out of the will
and kicked him off the estate," Ainsworth
plunged, giving Trascott a terse summing-up of
Rex Britton's explanations.  "He has left three
hundred pounds of money, three mountains of
pride, and the strength of three bulls.  He's off
to Canada and the Yukon!"

Trascott stilled his surprise and bent earnestly
over the table.

"I'd stay," he advised pointedly.  "You can
live down the disinheritment and open the
barricaded doors of position.  I'd stay in England
and live it down."

Britton was sullen and decided.  "No," he
returned, "I'm out of England till I can buy
back everything I've lost.  Understand?  I'm
disappearing from the dearly beloved public
which takes such an interest in my misfortune
and in my future.  Isn't that what victims of
circumstance try?  I'll be welcomed as the
prodigal nephew when I return–if I ever do!"

"Don't be cynical," Trascott warned.  "It's
dangerous in your case."

"What would you have me do?" Rex exclaimed
warmly.  "Shall I turn gamekeeper or valet?
And don't think I'm priggish!  I dare be menial,
but, by Jove, I won't be a slave!  Independency
is my obsession.  That's why I'm for this new
gold-trail."

And the gold-trail held its persistent lure in
spite of any arguments.

Two weeks later he sighted Newfoundland
from the decks of an Allan Liner, passed through
the waters of Belle Isle, chafing on Labrador's
iron coast, caught up Heath Point on bleak
Anticosti, and won the river-stretch of four hundred
and thirty-eight miles to Quebec.  Twelve hours
more and the liner anchored in the port of
Montreal.

Rex Britton had hunted for three seasons in
the Laurentians, and at Montreal he hastened to
find two comrades of the chase who had always
been members of his party.  One was the
voyageur, Pierre Giraud, and the other a plainsman,
Jim Laurance, who had drifted up from some
place in the Southern States.  Britton inquired
for them in their old haunts.

"Pierre?" cried a French riverman, at his
question; "Pierre an' Jim Laurance?  Dey bot'
gon' on de Yukon.  Beeg strik' dere–ver' beeg
strik'."

Further enquiry elicited the information that
Jim Laurance was keeping a road-house at Indian
River, on the Dawson Trail, while Pierre Giraud
was some place in the land of gold without his
whereabouts being definitely known.

On hearing this news Britton dallied no
further, but crossed the continent alone, caught
a Puget Sound boat and steamed north.  All the
way up people talked insane things of a new
strike east of Juneau, and, like a fool, he listened.
Like a fool, also, he rushed in hot haste with the
van of the stampede which followed the boat's
touching at Juneau.  The lure of gold faded
somewhat for him when they reached the
much-touted valley and found that not a hundredth
part of what had been reported was true.

Though hope was lessened in immense proportion,
still Britton staked with his fellows, only
to have his ardor dampened still more.  The
bedrock of his claim was as clean of yellow grains
as a well-swept floor, and while his neighbors
struck pay-gravel of moderate richness, a curse
of bad luck blanked his own efforts.

Twice more he did the same thing, once on
Admiralty Island and again at Glacier Bay below
Mount Crillon.  Each time he reported his
ill-success to Jim Laurance by letters which he sent
with in-going steamers to Dyea, whence they
were borne onward over Chilcoot by the Dawson
mail-carriers.  And Laurance, deprived of the
satisfaction of replying on account of Britton's
itinerancy, sat in his road-house at Indian River
and waited for the Englishman to come to him.
He held as a truism his own saying that the
Dawson Trail knew every leg in the Yukon at
some time or other, and he did not doubt for an
instant that Britton's legs would presently
appear, straining through the weary miles like
the countless pairs of limbs he had seen stamping
over the route which led to the Mecca of the
gold-lands.

Having wasted the summer months and a great
part of his money in three futile stampedes,
Britton found himself upon the Dyea beach at
the approach of winter, with another *ignis fatuus*
luring him on the inward trail.  A tremendous
rush was on to Forty Forks, east of Lake Marsh,
where, it was said, a prospector had kicked over
glistening nuggets with the soles of his hobnailed
cruisers.  The wildest reports of wealth were
circulating, as usual, and men went forward in
mad haste to locate on the creek before the white
breath of winter should blot out the face of the land.

Britton, grown wary through bitter experience,
cut the reports down to a sounder basis of
common sense, sifted out apparent exaggerations
and discrepancies, and decided that Forty Forks
was at least worth trying for, although, when he
remembered three successive defeats, he
misdoubted the issue.

Dyea was in a ferment.  Boat-loads of
passengers and baggage crowded the beach and camp,
and this tangled rabble resolved itself into a
perpetual stream of in-going Klondikers heading
over the pass to take advantage of the yet open
waterway from Linderman.

The tang of first frost was in the gray morning
air as Britton pushed along the rough, bouldered
wagon-road which runs up the Dyea Valley.
Hundreds went, like him, on foot, while those
blessed with a full money-belt procured what
teamsters' wagons were to be had and lashed
ahead in frantic haste that soon brought Canyon
City in sight.  From there to Sheep Camp the
travel was more congested; the weaker men
already began to lag; the first strain of the race
told on the physically unfit.

All the way on to the Scales Britton passed
faltering fellows, singly or in groups of twos and
threes.  They cursed him in a despairing way
for his stalwart legs and sturdy back, and he
came to recognize that here at last was a country
where they measured a man according to his
manliness, uninfluenced by extraneous attributes.

Where the trail ascended Chilcoot, the footing
grew worse, and a mighty climb confronted those
who would cross the pass.  Britton's strength
here stood him in good stead, for in addition to
the arduous toil of the ascent there arose the
handicap of a bitterly cold wind which began to
filter through the mountains, carrying ominous
snow-flurries.  The icy blast numbed the climbers'
muscles and sapped their energies, and as if
conscious of its power, the northland loosed its lungs
and blew a brawling storm down from the higher
plateaus.

Minute by minute the shrieking wind increased
in velocity, whirling sleet and snow in the faces
of the toiling men, till their persons were
encrusted, and the mountain path grew white and
obscure.  A gold-seeker slipped upon a rock
ahead of Britton and rolled back against his
legs.  Rex pulled him up and turned him round.
"Say, old friend, what do you call this?" he
gasped.

"Holy road to Nome!" blasphemed the other,
rubbing his bruised limbs.  "Don't you know
a blizzard when you meet one?  Keep your
mouth shut in this cold, or you won't make the
pass."

It was indeed a blizzard of the roaring,
ramping type that only the Yukon knows, and it
increased to diabolical fury as the toilers reached
the steepest pitch of the mountain.  Men went
down beside the trail in sheer exhaustion, and
the agony of their position appealed more
strongly to Britton on account of his inability
to render any lasting aid.  This, of all the
northern trails, was the Iron Trail where none but the
strong could survive.

Seeing old-timers and hardened sourdoughs
fall behind filled Britton with a glow of pride in
his own capabilities.  He understood that he
was one of the fit to whom reward must finally
come, and the thought instilled new hope.

Over towering Chilcoot he climbed, in the teeth
of that memorable blizzard which froze a score
of gold-seekers between the Scales and the divide
from Crater Lake.  Nothing but his magnificent
physique and indomitable purpose carried him
on, and when he staggered across the little glacier
which sloped to Crater Lake he had won his way
to the front, and was once more in the van of a
stampede.  As Britton thawed himself in the
camp there beside a grizzled Alaskan who had
followed every strike from Nome to Klondike
City, the old-timer regarded him admiringly.

"You're the hot stuff, mate," he averred,
"when you can heel old Larry Marsh over
Chilcoot in that there hell-warmer.  You're some
stampeder, too!  Wasn't you in the front 'long
of me at Juneau and Glacier Bay?"

"I believe I remember you," Britton said,
"although it did us precious little good to be
in the front."

The old man warmed his hairy paws for the
tenth time and shook his gray locks.

"Don't whine!  Never whine, friend," he
remarked.  "You get experience, grantin' nothin'
else.  You're sure some stampeder, and I reckon
they'll be namin' you 'long of Larry Marsh–him
that named Marsh Lake!"

And forthwith Britton's name travelled widely
in fulfilment of the old-timer's prophecy; they
began to designate him as one of their
stampeders, that much-respected minority of men
who have the grit and the power to stay in the
lead of the maddest of all mad races–the gold-rush.

The halt at Crater Lake Camp was, of necessity,
very short.  The stragglers were limping in,
frost-bitten and exhausted, telling of some who
would never come in, when Marsh and Britton
again hit the trail.  Dead men nor mountains,
frosts nor blizzards, sufficed to stay the stampede.

The lower levels were strangely quiet after the
bellowings of the windy pass, and the cold did not
bite so keenly.

The rush passed on by Deep Lake and Long
Lake, where fat purses could buy the assistance
of pack-trains of mules as far as Linderman.
When they reached the shore of this lake, they
were twenty-eight miles from Dyea, with the
giant bulk of Chilcoot looming between, its
rugged head still wrapped in the swirling white
blizzard.

From the head of Lake Linderman the boats,
bought or built for different individuals, plied
on the water-route which led by Lake Marsh and
the Forty Forks onward to Dawson.  There were
small barges, but their sailings were very
uncertain and could not be depended on in a
rush.  Each man who dared the waterway before
the very maw of winter had to buy or make his
craft at Linderman.

Here on the shore a motley throng congregated,
with Marsh and Britton in the front ranks.
Some Nevada capitalists who had lost their
horses along the trail and hired Indian packers
to carry their goods over the pass at sixty cents a
pound, clamored for boats to a stocky Dane, who
appeared to be a perfect genius at turning out
freshly sawn planks as the finished product,
ready seamed and caulked, with mast stepped, and
altogether seaworthy.  However, something else
beside clamor and a profligate show of money was
necessary for the securing of the vessels, and that
was time.  Work as they might, the boat-builders
could not supply the demand, and any with skill
in carpentering fell to toiling of their own will in
order to get boat after boat away and thus hasten
their own turn.  They were pitting human
celerity and skill against the unceasing advance
of winter.  The freeze-up was approaching with
chill, unpitying certainty to snuff out delayed
hopes by the close of navigation, and through
superhuman effort the gold-seekers thought to
forestall the frost's advent.

Every day the march of Arctic feet could be
defined more clearly; every night the snow-line
slid a little farther down the hills; north-east
squalls blew up at unexpected hours; and the
rivers strained their waters through arrays of
icy teeth stuck along the margins.

Amidst the turmoil of Linderman, when
others had done with exhortations, expostulations,
and entreaties, through the universal desire
for speed, Larry Marsh drew one Danish
boat-builder aside and conferred with him.

Whatever magic he used or whatever service
of old needed repayment, Britton did not know,
but he saw the Dane hand over a newly launched
skiff to the gray Alaskan.

"Hey! you," the latter called to him, "come
and steer this boat.  You're the man for me!"

Britton threw in his outfit with glad promptitude,
and they shoved off through the seething
shore ice, which was ground to fragments as
quickly as it formed.

"Keep her head straight," warned Larry
Marsh.  "I'll 'tend to this here sail."

He busied himself with the squaresail, a large
sheet that caught the sweeping wind and whirled
them down Lake Linderman like a flash.

A mile portage connected Linderman with the
next lake, Bennett.  The swift water was not
navigable for large boats in the ordinary way,
so Britton brought the skiff to in a manner which
showed he was a skilful sailor and which Marsh
did not fail to note.

"You've held a tiller before now, I'll warrant,"
he said.  "Most greenies would have piled the
boat up on them boulders in the rapid.  Let's
pack the outfits across and line her down to Bennett!"

Accordingly, having first portaged their goods,
they lined the skiff carefully through foaming
white-water down to Lake Bennett, where they
again embarked.  From the Police post at the
head of the lake the sergeant was watching a
Government courier struggling in with a
Peterborough through the gale that raged.  Britton
and Marsh saw him also as they staggered under
their press of sail.

"He's in trouble," Rex cried.  "Hadn't I better
run closer?"

The courier was paddling mightily, but the
squall which had caught him half way up
Bennett proved too strong.  It was gradually
defeating him in spite of his desperate efforts.

"It'll swamp him in a minute," Marsh declared,
eyeing the helpless man.  "I guess you'd better
run past."

The skiff bore in toward the canoe just as a
huge, white-capped wave threatened to bury it.
The stout fellow met it bravely with a sweeping
stroke.  The spray hid the Peterborough's nose
for an instant, and it seemed as if the craft
would never rise.

"She's under!" shouted Britton.

"No, she lifts," cried his companion.  "See,
on the wave-top!  By heavens, it's mountain-high!
Snap!–there goes his paddle."

The blade had broken clean in two under the
tremendous strain.  The Peterborough spun
round like a cork on the crest of the surf; the
courier grasped for his spare paddle, knotted to
the thwarts, but another wave capsized him
before he could dip it.

Britton brought the boat's head round, and
the skiff drifted past the spot.  The drenched
man clung desperately to the careening,
upturned Peterborough.  Britton jammed the tiller
hard to windward, and Marsh cast a rope.  It
missed.

"Here," said Rex, "keep the helm down, and
I'll catch him as we drift."

Old Larry took his place.  Britton stretched
himself on the gunwale, like a cat, and grabbed
the drowning courier's collar as they rocked
alongside.  A powerful jerk, and the soaked
fellow lay shivering in the bottom of the skiff!

He was a Corsican and spoke bad English.
While they reeled down the thirty miles of
Bennett before the screaming gale, he patted
Britton's shoulder in gratitude.

"I must ask thanks–much thanks for you,"
he kept reiterating.

They beached the courier at an Indian camp
by Cariboo Crossing and drove on through
Tagish Lake.  The wind veered and baffled them,
and the seas gave them hours of icy baling.
Britton did not count the tacks they made, but
it must have been a hundred before they reached
Tagish Post, where the boat was put in for good.
The Englishman was not at all sorry to see it
permanently tied up and to be free of its cramped
quarters, although the skiff had served them such
a good turn.

He stretched his toil-stiffened muscles and
stamped about on the ice-piled beach, the
Alaskan following suit.  Rex thought the latter's
face had a wan, tired look, and he realized how
wearing were these desperate drives in the teeth
of overwhelming hardships.

"I reckon we've got the rest beat by a long
shot," Marsh observed.  "Nevada coin-slingers
ain't in it with us!  I know a short trail to Forty
Forks by skirtin' Lake Marsh, so we can snooze
at the Post to-night and hit it in the mornin'."

They slept in comfort for once, sheltered at
Mounted Police headquarters, but before
sunrise they were afoot and circling the first
headland of Lake Marsh.  Some hours after, the other
boats began to arrive, and the land-rush was
renewed with fresh vigor.

"What do you think of my namesake?" asked
the Alaskan, as they turned east from Lake
Marsh's shore.

Britton looked at the sullen sweep of white-crested
water with the rubble of ice rattling on
every wave, at the thickening films over the
inlets, and at the ever-descending snow-line on the
bleak ridges.

"I think it will be closed before thirty-six
hours," he said.

It was a tyro's guess, and for the only time
within the knowledge of Larry Marsh the tyro's
guess came true.  The next evening he saw the
freeze-up and the death of many a man's hopes.
The death of their own hopes crept round in
a different way.

A mile below Forty Forks they met Jack McDonald,
or "Scotty," as he was generally termed,
a famous dog-musher of the Yukon, a skilled
prospector, and a friend of Marsh.

"Headin' for the strike?" he asked in his
broad Scotch accent.  "Then ye maun turn
aroun'.  'Tisna worth a dang."

Britton's eager look faded.  Larry Marsh
glanced up with sharp disgust.

"'Scotty'," he said, "you're not joking?"

"Joke, mon!" exclaimed McDonald.  "I cam'
frae Le Barge tae look ower the groun', an' yon
dinna seem like a joke.  I tell ye 'tisna worth a
dang."

Marsh believed the announcement because it
was uttered by the Scotchman.  He relied on
McDonald's judgment as he would on his own,
and he turned about on the trail.

"That's gospel if 'Scotty' says so," he
observed to Rex.  "It's no use of us wastin' time.
Back-trail's the word!"

Britton was loath to give up so near the goal
when his expectations were so summarily scattered.

"It's only a mile to the new camp," he said.
"I think I'll go on and have a look.  One never
can tell what may turn up."

Larry Marsh shouldered his pack-sack again.

"All right," he grunted.  "Where you goin',
McDonald?"

"South o' Le Barge," the Scotchman answered.
"I had a trace there before I cam' awa' on
this fool trip."

"I'm with you," cried Marsh, "and we'll
follow it to the end."  To Britton he added: "Come
with us, and we'll put you in right if anything
goes!"

The idea seemed vague and forlorn, and Rex
shook his head.

"I'll glance over the Forks anyway," he decided.

They took the back-trail, and he tramped on.
A week at Forty Forks was convincing enough!
He returned to Tagish Post, a very downhearted
man, and the first person he saw was the
Government courier, Franco Lessari, whom he had
pulled out of Lake Bennett.

"I ask much thanks–for you, much thanks,"
the Corsican greeted with a new show of
gratitude.  "For your kind heart I repay–so little.
Listen!  Far up Samson Creek, I tell you
for go on the north branch.  Look there for gold!"

Britton smiled indulgently.  It was only
another of the five hundred kindly hints which had
been given him by well-disposed people; for
well-disposed people never think that these vague
pieces of information, very often acquired simply
by hearsay, waste a man's time, by sending him
off on false and useless scents.  Britton had had
plenty of such news, and he thought no more of
it till he heard it whispered about the Post that
there was something big on Samson Creek.

He learned, too, that Franco Lessari had
quitted the Government service to go prospecting,
and that lent more significance to what the
Corsican had told him.  When he went to bed that
night, he counted the contents of his slack
money-belt.  There remained about enough to purchase
a team of dogs, with some dollars left over for
supplies.  With his present means he could go
on one more stampede.  If he failed to strike
anything, he would be stranded.  Success or failure
depended upon which direction he took.  There
was another rumor in the air, the tale of riches
in the Logan Valley, and he did not know which
way to turn.  In his strait he remembered the
fatalistic beliefs of the Arabs in Algiers, and
flipped a coin to decide whether he should go on
or turn back.

It fell heads–to go on–and Britton accepted
the decision.  Larry Marsh and McDonald had
gone south of Lake Le Barge, so he purchased
his dogs from another musher and set forth next
day.  The frost held lakes and rivers with
two-foot ice, and the snow had fallen heavily for a
week.

He worked across the frozen lakes; ranged the
jammed curves of Thirty Mile River; and
reached the ice bridges of the White Horse.
The travelling was tedious, and he saved his dogs,
going into camp every night at six.

At the Mounted Police post on the Big Salmon,
Britton rested half a day, and then mushed
along, undeterred by a filled trail, to the Little
Salmon, Pelly, and Selkirk, making halts where
he must.

Between Selkirk and Stewart River, when
Britton pulled out at dawn, he could discern
another team travelling behind him at a considerable
distance.  He watched it with interest
because it was the first company he had seen on
the trail since leaving Big Salmon, but the sled
did not appear to come any nearer no matter how
slowly he himself mushed.

"Who's behind?" asked the keeper of the
roadhouse at Stewart River, when Britton passed
through.

"Don't know," Rex answered.  "He will not
come close enough for examination."

"A shirker!" was the man's judgment on the
laggard team, as he watched the Englishman's
sturdy figure breaking the way to Sixty Mile.

   CHAPTER VII.

.. vspace:: 2

Where the heavy trail from Sixty Mile forged
toward Indian River, Rex Britton halted his
dog-train and eyed with an odd glance, half relief,
half reproach, the dog-sled which was now
rapidly approaching from the rear.

"Humph!" he growled through his fur hood,
"the gentleman of the rear-guard has a
conscience after all.  He apparently knows the
unwritten law of the Yukon that travellers take
turns in breaking the trail."

A fresh fall of snow had buried the Dawson
route, and, unlucky as usual, Britton had found
it his task to pack the loose stuff all the way
from the Big Salmon.  The other dog-train that
had mushed behind him since morning had not
offered to do its duty till now.  The four o'clock
gray was showing in the sky.  Night lurked in
the river shadows.  Britton breathed his dogs a
little longer and waited.

The sled behind was drawn by a five-dog team
like his own, but the huskies appeared far
fresher.

"Been nursing them while I've done the
work!" was his exclamation–"mighty good
driver, too.  By George, it's a woman!"

Britton's wide eyes strained to catch the detail
of the figure.  As the distance lessened, his
supposition was proven true.  He saw the novel sight
of a five-dog team being urged at full speed over
that lonely trail by a mere slip of a girl.

"Gaucho, you lean beggar!" he cried to his
leader.  With a jump the animal tautened the
traces to the shrill menace of the lash.  The
runners coughed a little in the sagging snow, and
Britton was off down the slope.

"You see it's a girl, you old wolf," he whimsically
explained.  "We can't let her break a trail.
No–not if we were dropping!"

Nevertheless his team travelled in a surly
fashion.  The skin on the backs of their necks
crinkled at the shriek of his whip.  They snarled
and fought in their harness despite the
punishment which followed.  The rear sled gained
steadily.  Soon a voice like a clear silver bell
hailed Britton.

"Wait!" she commanded.  "I'll take my turn.
Your dogs are weakening.  I should have come
to the front sooner, only I must travel all night
and need to spare my team."

"I'm all right," Britton shouted back.  "Laurance's
cabin is my stop.  The huskies will last."

"I insist," the girl cried, urging her animals
so that they nosed the packs on Britton's sleigh.

"And I refuse," he called over his shoulder.
"You shouldn't be on this trail anyway.  It's
not safe to travel alone.  You're surely not mad
enough to attempt a night trip?"

The girl straightened her shoulders haughtily,
and the face, framed in a white-furred hood,
took on a dignity which would have been lost on
the man had not the physical beauty of the
countenance forced its impression.

"Let me pass!" she tersely commanded, pulling
her dogs into the powdery snow at one side
of Britton's packed trail.

"Pass me, then," he said, a little nettled, and
forced his team to topmost speed.

Invited into a race, the girl soon showed the
mettle of herself and of her animals.  Before
Britton reached the river-arm, she drew abreast.
The trail sloped downward, and the dogs had
but little to stay their lope.  The two teams raced
side by side, the leaders snapping at each other.

.. _`"The two teams raced side by side, the leaders snapping at each other"`:

   :alt: "The two teams raced side by side, the leaders snapping at each other."

   "The two teams raced side by side, the leaders snapping at each other."

"They'll fight in a minute and pile us both
up," the girl cried excitedly.

Britton, gazing on her face, was struck with an
old, poignant pain.  For a second, he thought it
was Maud Morris.  The features were there; the
same teeth, the same rose-hued cheeks, the same
sunny hair about the temples!  The resemblance
was remarkable, and, forgetting the swift
descent, Britton stared.

Gaucho, over-zealous to maim the rival leader,
stumbled, and a spill seemed imminent, but
Britton's skilful lash sorted him out, thereby
increasing the momentum of the train till the teams
rushed neck and neck again.

"It's a dead heat," he said grimly.  "We had
better slacken speed before we cross the ice or
neither sleigh will go any farther."

"Agreed," smiled the hooded beauty, reining
in.  Her color was heightened by the ride, and,
as she pushed the furry fringes from her mouth
to admit of freer breathing, Britton could have
sworn it was the face of Maud Morris.  Only,
the eyes had a serene depth of expression which
bespoke soul and purity.  Therein lay the difference!

"Say," he began, confusedly, "you're
like–you're the perfect mould of someone I know.
Her name is Morris.  Ah!  I have it now!  Such
likeness can't exist without sisterhood.  You're
a sister of Maud Morris!"  His voice was intense
in its eagerness.

"I am not!" came the decidedly staccato
answer, tinged with contempt.  "Be careful,"
she added warningly.  "There's a jam on this
arm."  They were sweeping the frozen river-bed,
bumping over the jutting ice-boulders piled
chaotically in a bend of the stream.

Britton took the lead, swinging briskly across
the jam.  The girl shouted a warning at his
evident carelessness.

"Do be cautious," she begged.  "The fresh
snow masks the water-holes in treacherous
bridges, and the current here is very swift."

Britton loped on without heed.  The girl
screamed, a second later.  Without warning one
runner of the foremost sled cut across a
snow-arched slush-hole.  Britton pitched backwards,
splashing through the sloppy mask as a stone
drops through scummy ooze.

The girl was at the place in three dog-leaps.
A dull blotch of open water showed where the
man had disappeared.  She jerked her sled
sidewise, as an anchor for her weight, grasped a
runner with one hand, and lowered her body as
far as possible, searching with despairing glances
for a reappearing head.  She gave a low cry of
agony when nothing showed, and began probing
wildly with her whip.  Its butt-end fell across
the taut ropes of Britten's sled, and, looking
up, the girl saw the dogs in a heap, well-nigh
strangled with the tension on the collars.
There was something on the other end!

She grasped the ropes and pulled with all the
strength of one arm.  After what seemed an age
of straining, Britton's black gauntlet pierced the
slush.  The lines were twisted tightly round his
wrist, and the girl frantically seized it.
However, the effort was useless.  By the passiveness
of the limb she knew him to be either stunned or
drowned, and past helping himself, while her
strength could not stir him.

Relaxing her grip, she pulled herself up the
side of the hole, ran to Britton's team, and lashed
it into activity in spite of the cramping collars.
In terror the huskies responded with their
supreme efforts, but they could not draw out
their master.

In hysterical sobbing now the girl brought her
own dogs, hitched them ahead, and slashed the
double team till the cruel whip flayed their hides.
To her blows she added prayers breathed between
terrified sobs.

At last the string of tortured dogs broke out
the sagging, anchoring thing, and Britton's
senseless body rolled into view with startling
suddenness.  The animals, at the quick release, dragged
it clear of the river before the girl could stop them.

Laurance's cabin showed just around the bend.
In a new lease of strength the feminine rescuer
rolled the man's body on his sleigh.  Calling to
her own team to follow, she made a dash for the
shelter of the cabin.

The headland reeled away; the ice-gaps ran
past till she drew up with a swirl in front of
Laurance's.  A group of suspicious huskies,
guarding the door, howled dubiously and charged
on the strange teams.  The girl cracked skulls
here and there in a frantic fashion.  The fear
that they might spring on the inert man possessed
her, but in a second the clamor reached Laurance
by his fire.

The door clanged back.  Several oaths,
puncturing the icy air like pistol-cracks, were
swallowed in a ridiculous gurgle when the old
Klondiker recognized the strange form as that of a
woman.

"He's drowned!" she screamed.  "Help him,
for God's sake!"

"Who?" bellowed Laurance, rushing out and
kicking dogs right and left.  "By me oath, it's
Britton, Rex Britton!  Where'd you come on
him, eh?"

"He fell in the river-jam!" she cried in
unsuppressed irritation.  "Don't talk–don't
question!  Do something!  It's time that counts.
You're losing time, man!"  Her voice filed off in
an upper break which told of racked nerves.

Laurance gripped Britton in his arms and
made the house with some little difficulty.  Rex
was a heavy man, and a bulky fellow seems twice
his own weight when the muscles are so lax.

"I don't think he's drowned near so much as
stunned," Laurance observed, as he laid the body
in a bunk behind the stove.  "Something's hit
him a hefty blow there."  He touched Britton's
forehead where a dark bruise showed.

"Nary a drown," he continued triumphantly,
as he ran a hand under thick Arctic clothing to
feel the breast.  "His heart's a-beatin'.  His
ribs heave some, too.  Nary a drown, I tell you.
The crack on the coco done the job, miss.  I'll
bring him round all up-to-date in a minnit or two."

The girl's convulsive sobbing made Laurance
look up in surprise.

"Don't you go for to take on so," he begged.
"You go quiet your nerves and make summat hot
in the kitchen room, for the cook's away.  I'll
dry-fix Britton, and he'll drink pints of scaldin'
tea when he wakes."

The girl obeyed, eager to do anything that
would help.  She busied herself over the
tea-making, and warmed some soup, made from
moose shoulder, which she found in the rough
cupboard.  At intervals, however, her anxiety
overcame her, and she called to Laurance in the
next room with questions as to Britton's
condition.  Reassuring replies came back in the
Klondiker's quaint vocabulary, replies that made her
smile when she could take her mind off Britton's
danger, since Laurance declared there was no
need to fear.

By the time she had the tea and soup ready,
Laurance came into the kitchen.

"He's come to–sort of dazed, though," was
his announcement.  "Got them things hot?"

"Steaming!" she answered, turning from the
stove.  The action brought her face in close range
of Laurance's eyes.  The tears were dried,
disfiguring sobs gone.  The sparkle of the eye and
the fire-tinged cheek made a rare sight.  The old
Klondiker gazed for a speechless minute, while
the girl's color deepened.

"Say, now," he stammered at last, "if I'd
never set eyes on the Rose of the Yukon, I'd take
me oath as you was her.  Blast me if you don't
resemble her like a twin.  Where're you from?"

"Dawson!–don't bother me," the girl replied
quickly.  "You are sure he will be perfectly
safe?  I wouldn't like to think–you see, I
believe it was my fault.  I tempted him to race.
He will take no harm?"

"Nary a bit," said Laurance, promptly.
"He'll be as right as a trivet when he gets
outside a good hot meal."

"Then give him these as soon as you like!"  She
indicated the tea and soup, and added: "I'll
thank you to tell him I'm sorry I was the cause
of his accident.  Just tell him I'm sorry."

Laurance caught up the boiling liquids in their
respective vessels and darted into the next room.
Rex Britton's senses were gradually steadying
themselves.  The hollow, rocky feeling was
passing away.  In a dry suit of Laurance's he half
reclined on the Alaska bunk, while the Klondiker
proceeded to administer to his needs by dipping
out the necessary nourishment.

"Where's the girl?" asked Britton, awkwardly.

"Out in the kitchen!  Say, isn't she a
Jim-Cracker from Jim-Crackerville, eh?  What's
her name?"

"Don't know!" said Rex.  "Why didn't you
ask her?"

"Bless me,–I–forgot," admitted Laurance.
"However, son, seein' as you're summat
interested, I'll attend to this here enquiry–"

A jingle of bells and the movement of a
dog-train outside clattered an interruption.

"Hello!" exclaimed Laurance, jumping up.
"Someone else blew in, eh?  Must be me day at
home."  He crossed quickly to the door and
flung it open.

"Who's arrived?" demanded Britton.

"H–l!" cried Laurance, in a non-committal
fashion, and dashed into the yard.

Vociferous shouting drifted in to Britton, and
when the Klondiker reappeared, he asked with
a shade of anxiety: "Anything wrong out
there?"

"She's gone," spluttered Laurance.  "She's
hiked with that bloody fast team of hers."

Britton leaped from the bunk to the doorway.
Around the bend of the trail the girl's outfit was
disappearing.  Full of a strange thrill of
disappointment and sense of indignity, he turned the
blame on Laurance.

"You blasted fool!" he roared, angrily.

"'Tain't my fault," the Klondiker threw
back.  "How'd I know she was goin' to
vamoose?  Must ha' thought we wasn't respectable
inhabitants."

"She said she intended to travel by night,"
explained Britton.  "I told her it wasn't safe,
but she laughed.  I'm going after her!"

Jim Laurance put his back to the door with a
certain grim determination.

"No, you ain't," he said, quietly.  "Sift some
sense into your cracked head.  Them dogs are
gee-whiners.  Yours wouldn't catch 'em in a
year.  No, siree!  That girl knows what she's
a-doin'.  She's been on trails afore this, and
don't you forgit it."

Britton sat down upon his bunk again,
convinced of the futility of trying to overtake the
splendid team of the unknown beauty.  Laurance
came back from the door and replenished
the fire.  His friend drank the rest of the soup
and tea in an absent manner.

"How do you shape?" asked Jim.

"Better," Rex grunted.

"Feel like a square meal?  It'll skeer off the
cold better'n slops.  They're all right to prick
your blood up, but they don't last like a
stomachful of bull moose.  Heh?"

"Hardly," Britton agreed.  "Bring out your
solid grub."

Laurance dived into the kitchen, returning
with a big platter of moosemeat and a tremendous
slab of pilot bread.  He put on a fresh pot
of tea, and they fell to, munching in silence
while dark crept under the door and into the
cabin corners.

When the meal was finished, the cabin was
wrapped in gloom.  Laurance opened the stove
door in order to save the expense of lighting a
candle.  In the Yukon smaller things than
candles count for much.  The firelight blocked
out the two men's figures in a ruddy smudge of
color.  Britton's massive frame showed larger
by a half than the wiry figure of Jim Laurance.
But though not bulky, the latter's muscles were
of steel.  His grizzled face was surmounted by
stubby, iron-gray hair which met the up-creep of
a disreputable beard in front of his rat ears.
The stolid monochrome of a countenance was
relieved only by the flash of two piercing blue
eyes and the cherry-red hue of a snub nose.  His
lips were seldom seen; they clung incessantly
to his pipe-stem under cover of the ragged
whisker-growth.

Britton's face, on the other hand, was a finely
moulded one; the harrying conditions and bitter
routines of the North appeared to have only
conserved and augmented its strength.  A broad
forehead, dark, fine hair above, regular features,
with chin and cheeks clean-shaven, and white,
even teeth showing when he smiled, made a
pleasant picture in the flame reflection.  His
muscle-corded shoulders, sturdy neck, and square
chin gave evidence of combined physical and
mental strength.

For a time the men smoked in silence, staring
into the coals, each busy with his own thoughts.
Presently Britton spoke.

"Perhaps she'll stay at Ainslie's camp for the
night," he said, more to himself than to his companion.

"Got the girl on your brain yet?" chirped
Laurance, mockingly.  "Kind of heroine of a
fair romance, ain't she?  Sort of angelic saviour
sent for your special benefit, heh?  'Spose you'd
a-dropped into that hole if she hadn't been
around?  Own up, now–honest Injun!"

"Can't say," evaded Britton.  "I was thinking
only of her safety.  We're all pretty rough
characters up here, but there are some d–d
rough ones on this trail.  At Stewart River they
told me that someone was robbing caches by
night between there and Dawson."

"The bloody cache-thief, or thieves,"
Laurance broke out–"they'll swing if we catch
them!  Anderson's cache, near Ainslie's camp,
was sandpapered clean two nights ago–not a
speck of anything left.  It's jumping-off time for
the man who did that–when they spot him!"

"Suppose now–well, I'd hate to think of the
girl meeting one of that breed," Britton ventured.

"Don't you fear," laughed Laurance.  "The
man as puts hand on her will catch a whole-fledged,
fire-spittin' Tartar.  What did I see in
her neat little belt when she loosed her coat in
front of me fire?  An ivory-heeled shootin'-iron,
if you ast me.  Don't worry, son.  Wimmen as
carries them things can use 'em.  If you met her
on the trail and was on evil bent she'd plug you
quicker'n scat.  You're d–d right.  She can
go through–if she wants to."

Something like a sigh heaved from Britton's
wide chest.  Laurance thought there was relief
in it.

"On course," he bantered, "you was thinkin'
of her safety.  You certain had nary a thought
of them red cheeks, them eyes, them lips–whoo!"

"Drop that!" Britton curtly ordered.  "You
know women aren't in my line."

"Where've you been these last weeks?" Laurance
asked, suddenly changing the subject.

"Following a fool stampede up Forty Forks,
beyond Lake Marsh."

"Hard luck again?"

"The worst."  Britton's disconsolate tone
told more than his brief answer.

"What's your latest idea?" his friend asked
after a doubtful pause.

"I've word of something on Samson Creek.
I'll outfit at Dawson and try for it.  The
Government courier gave me the hint at Tagish Post.
I pulled him out of a cold bath he was taking in
Lake Bennett once.  He didn't forget it."

"Humph!" Laurance growled, reaching for
more wood and stoking up after the old-timer's
fashion.

"It's my last stampede," Britton continued
in an odd, tense voice.  "I'm nearly down and
out, and I'm staking all.  If I fail this time, it's
back over this cursed trail to Dyea on beans and
horsehide.  I'll wash dishes in the scullery of a
Puget Sound boat or do something of the like.
If I fail, Laurance, I'll have seen the last of the
Yukon."

"What brought you here, son?" asked
Laurance, kindly.  He leaned forward and put a
hand on the younger man's shoulder.  "What
brought you to this God-forsaken Yukon?" he
repeated.  "I've heard of you playin' a
hard-luck game on four stampedes.  You've took the
bumps right along like a vet'ran, but summat's
agin you.  You wasn't bred to this here.  Your
hands is too fine-shaped.  Your head's too keen.
Your speech is high-flown.  Rex Britton, you
turned your back on a better place in England
than you'll light on here.  I'm certainly certain
of that.  Tell me why you come, son?"

A new light gleamed in Britton's eyes.  His
stern countenance softened as under the
influence of some far-away dream.  He got up and
paced the floor for a little.  Finally, he flung
himself back in the chair with an air of resignation.

"I've never told anyone here," he said, "but
I'll tell you, Jim.  Perhaps I don't need to say
it; of course, it was a woman.  The old, old
story!  I'm a strong man, Laurance, and I'd
scorn to hold the feminine sex responsible for
my vicissitudes.  Still, as the philosophers have
it, 'In the beginning it was a woman.'  We'll
go to the starting line.  Listen!

"My family was one of the best in the old
land.  It consisted of three members, parents
and myself.  Both parents are dead–as you
know.  After graduating from college, I
commenced a tour of the Orient, for recreation
mostly.  The patrimony left me was small, but I
was heir to my uncle, who owns Britton Hall,
the Sussex estate, and a post in the foreign
diplomatic service was waiting for me when I
should come back.

"Getting quickly to the point, I rescued a
wonderfully attractive woman on a sinking
vessel in the harbor of Algiers.  I believe I
cracked some Berber skulls in the process, and
got a knife-thrust through the shoulder muscles
in return.

"She bound the wound, Laurance, and nursed
it, lingering in Algiers for that purpose.  Our
meetings were hourly, you might say!  I had
my uncle's yacht at my disposal, and all the
delights of the capital invited our participation,
so you may judge that the days and nights
passed very pleasantly.

"I had friends there whom I should have
considered, but I neglected them in the other
fascination; for it was fascination, Jim–the kind
of beautiful web that the spider spins."  Britton
paused with a snappy intake of breath while
Laurance, unwilling to interrupt, swung the
stove door to and fro with a moccasined foot.

"You know the atmosphere of romance surrounding
any such happening," Britton finally
went on.  "The lady was beautiful, marvellously
so, in fact, and well versed in worldly artifice.
I was still young enough to have the rainbow
focus on life.  The days went quickly in the
picturesque port.  The girl–she told me she was
twenty-four and unmarried–remained in the
place, recuperating from the shock of her
accident.  What's the use of elaborating, though!
You know how a love dream grows, Jim
Laurance.  You must have had one somewhere in
your own old, grizzled existence.  Algiers is
sunny.  The flowers are fragrant there.  Love
feeds on sun and flowers, moon and mountains,
starry nights, and all that.  I was young,
Laurance, and she was old in the craft.  Could you
blame me for being such a fool?  Sometimes I
hardly blame myself.

"For nearly a mouth things developed.  We
were engaged.  That city by the Mediterranean
became a Paradise for me.  Then–then–"  Britton's
voice broke away in bitterness.

"Then what?" his friend prompted.

"Her husband came hunting for her!"

"H–l!" Laurance gritted.  His feet fell to
the floor with a bang.  "She duped you!" he
added, softly.

"Sheared the lamb," Britton, said, with
severe, self-directed irony.  "The whole affair
came out.  Her husband tried to shoot me.
Instead, I laid him up for weeks.  Then they came
at me for damages, and the she-devil framed a
charge of seduction.  I was the sensation of
courts and yellow journals for half a year.
When I got clear at last, the attendant
circumstances worked their effect.  The thing smirched
my name and killed my diplomatic chances.  It
ruined my life when it was brightest with
promise.  It caused my uncle to disinherit and
wash his hands of me.  That's why I cut the
Isles, Laurance.  That's why I'm here."

Britton rose to his towering height, with
clenched hands, as if he were beginning the
fight with the North, as if he were storming the
Yukon's iron fastness for the first time.
Laurance could picture him thus, setting foot on
bleak Dyea beach.  The old Klondiker took his
pipe out of his mouth and forgot to replace it.
In lieu of that he reached a knotted fist to
Britton's palm.

"Son, I'm sorry," he said.  This from a
hardened Alaskan was much, for in that country, as
a rule, no one is sorry for any person but
himself.  There, in a running fight, it is every man
for his own interests, and the devil take the
laggards and the weak!

"Do you love her?" Laurance ventured, a
second later.

"I'm cured," Britton laughed, bitterly.
"Hasn't the draught been strong enough?"

The old man returned his pipe-stem to his
lips.  "Better a good burn-out," he mumbled,
"the rubbish won't catch sparks agin.  What
was her name?"

"Maud Morris, wife of Christopher Morris,"
his friend answered.  "I saw a man who knew
them when I came through Winnipeg.  He told
me that Morris had gone all to pieces through
drink and fast living.  At that time they had
come direct to Seattle.  I don't know where they
are now–and don't care to know!"

Britton settled back in his seat and refilled
his pipe.  The recounting of his story had been
in some measure a relief, although the old taste
of rancid memory remained.

"You're well out of it, son," Laurance
observed, after another vigorous stoking of the
stove.  "You're bloody well clear, though you've
stumped through such a hard-luck siege.  I hope
your last deal pans out some better.  I'd hate
to see you fall down.  You're too good a man."

"Have you met Pierre Giraud lately?" Britton
inquired.  "I wonder if he'd join me.  We've
tramped many a trail together."

"Pierre's due here to-night," Laurance said
quickly.  "He won't join you, though.  He has
a fine thing toting the goods of some Dawson
big gun out to Thirty Mile River.  His royal
nibs is going out–bound for the States–and he
has Giraud under contract to pack him along."

"Too bad," Britton mused.  "Pierre's worth
three ordinary men en route.  Many's the mile
we've paddled, and many's the moose we've
missed.  *Bon camarade* is Giraud, if there was
ever one."

"I saw him beat two blaggards on the
stampede into Nome," Laurance began reminiscently.
"The guys started in to argue the right
of way with Pierre.  Weighty beggars they was,
too, but Giraud put 'em both out of action in
ten seconds.  Shiftiest man on the route, less it's
yourself, Britton."

Rex shook his head as disclaiming the honor.
Outside a shrill howl broke the night silence and
started a hundred echoes.  Rex lifted his head
sharply.

"What's the matter with the husky?" he
asked.  "The moon's not up."

"Someone's coming," Laurance answered,
listening intently to a musical sound.

The faint tinkle of bells grew clearer.  The
rushing sound of a laden dog-train made the
cabin walls vibrate.

"*Arrêtes!*" commanded a leonine voice in
the yard, and the noise died suddenly.

"It's Pierre," cried Laurance, jumping to his feet.

   CHAPTER IX.

The door was kicked open without ceremony,
and Pierre's head popped in.

"Hello, you young cheechako!" yelled Britton, gaily.

"*Holá! mon camarade*, you tam ole
stampeder!" cried Giraud, rushing in with
outstretched hands.  "By de gar, Ah nevaire t'ink
Ah find you here.  Ah s'pose you seex hondred
mile back–*saprie*, yes."  He pulled off his
Arctic hood, disclosing a veritable voyageur's head,
handsome, debonair, crowned with coal-black
curls and lightened by the ever-changing play
of his fine eyes, sombre-hued as his hair.
Pierre's face was full of a certain reckless beauty,
and riveted attention by his daring, wilderness-bred
fascination.  Camaraderie spilled out of
his infectious laugh and his habitant speech.

Thus the two friends remained, the one
sitting, the other standing, raking each other with
volleys of cross-questions.  They talked like a
pair of chattering jays, trying to gather in the
threads of the more recent incidents that had
befallen each, till Laurance interrupted them.

"Sit down and eat," he said to Pierre, "I'll
unhitch your team."

It was then the current of excitement, which
Giraud appeared to have difficulty in suppressing,
burst to the surface.  He sprang to Laurance's
side and caught his arm.

"*Non, non!*" he exclaimed.  "Wait wan leetle
w'ile.  Ah breeng news.  We want dat sled
sure t'ing.  De cache-thief–you hear of heem?"

Laurance's keen blue eyes flashed.  "Is he
pinched?" he cried, eagerly.  "Have you seen him?"

Britton rose from his chair in vague alarm.
He was thinking of the girl travelling alone over
the trail.  "Speak, Pierre," was his tart order,
"you know something.  Out with it!"

"You leesten den," Giraud began, excitedly.
"Ah come by de cache on Silver Hollow *après*
de dark she fall.  Wat t'ink Ah find?  De cache
broken open.  De stuff all gone to *diable*.  Dat
thief not ver' far away–Ah know dat for sure
t'ing by de tracks.  Ah t'ink we get fresh dogs
here an' catch heem–catch heem!"  Pierre
jumped about and flourished his brawny arms
in emphasis.

"Anderson he geeve reward," he continued.

"How much?" Britton broke in, a new
incentive gripping him.

"Wan t'ousand tollars to de mans w'at catch
dis *canaille*–"

"Come on," roared his friend, jumping into
his travelling-gear.  "Come on, Pierre; we'll
pull down that thousand."

He was at the door in a second, calling to his
huskies.  Giraud ran after, boiling with impatience.

"Hold on!" called Laurance.  "Though I'd
like to be in on this job, I can't leave my
cabin–not with Mister Feather-Fingers dabbling
about, and the cook's over at Stewart for grub."

"Jove!  I forgot that," said Britton, hooking
up his team.  "It's rather a shame, Jim.  We'd
like to have you come."

"Can't," Laurance grunted, dismally.  "Still,
you can have my dogs.  Snap 'em on ahead.  If
it comes to speedin', you'll catch a runaway
easier."  He ordered the big animals out, and
Rex prepared to harness them ahead of his own.

"It's a long string," he said, dubiously.
"They'll take some managing."

"Wait," commanded Pierre.  "Ah feex dat.
Ah have de double yoke."

He pulled a double pack outfit from his sled
and selected the harness, tracing the dogs up in
pairs.  Three minutes more and they were
gliding over the trail, leaving Laurance watching
from the mellow blur of his firelit doorway.

"Did you meet a sled drawn by five dogs?"
Britton asked, as they sped over the smooth
plateau beyond Laurauce's.

"*Oui*," answered Pierre.  "Ah meet wan an'
pass heem on de Grand Reedge."

"Stop?"

"*Non*.  De mans nevaire speak.  He hurry, mebbe."

"It was a girl!" said Britton, abruptly.

"*Ciel!*" gasped Pierre, in surprise.  "Wat
tell *moi*?  She drive lak *diable*."

"Yes," Britton assented, "the dogs were very
fast.  She had mine beaten before we came to
Laurance's.  Of course, that was my stop."

Giraud's elbow gave a warning prod to his
companion's ribs as they slid down Silver
Hollow to the place which the voyageur had mentioned.

It was a cache built after the manner of the
North for storing purposes or for preserving
baggage for future freighting.  Anderson had
used it for years and had never before
experienced any trouble with pillagers.  Indeed, the
inexorable law of Yukon miners was sufficient
to make any of the light-handed gentry think
twice before opening a cache.  This was one of
the crimes for which swift justice was meted.

Britton and the voyageur examined the
snow-bound hummock carefully, lighting a torch to
scrutinize the tell-tale tracks in the
wind-screened valley.  The imprints were very fresh,
and had evidently been made by one man with
a dog-train.

During the momentary investigation Britton's
thoughts revolved swiftly.  From the amount of
goods stolen, he judged that the robber did not
intend travelling far.  Probably he had in view
some secret cache where he could hide the
plunder till an opportunity of getting rid of
portions of it should be presented.

"Did you notice the little cache by the
stream when you came over Grand Ridge?"
Britton asked.

"*Certainement!*" Pierre answered.  "She be
not touched.  Ah look for dat."

"Then the fellow must be working on the
in-trail.  He never passed Laurance's.  He never
passed you.  You're sure the fast five-dog team
was the only one you met?"

"Tam sure," Pierre vigorously asserted.  "Ah
have de sharp eyes!"

"In that case he must have left the route
somewhere between Laurance's and Grand
Ridge.  He wouldn't go far with such a bulk of
stuff.  We have to find his track where he left
the main trail.  The moon's just up.  In ten
minutes it will be as clear as day.  This is our
chance for five hundred apiece.  We earn it
between here and Grand Ridge.  Whip up those dogs!"

Britton's tone was exultant.  To the spice of
adventure in running down a contemptible thief
was added the lure of the reward which Anderson
had offered.  He needed that five hundred!
In fact, it would be like money from home just
at the critical juncture of his last stampede.
His funds were barely sufficient to provide a
proper outfit for the arduous trip up Samson
Creek.  This wind-fall–if the breeze held his
way–would remedy the deficit in the budget.

Pierre, with all the craft of the old musher,
had his dogs well in hand, and the long walrus-hide
whip sang out with a final snap at the ears
of the leaders that sent them loping like a
whirlwind.  The voyageur scanned one side of their
route for any signs of a dog-train having turned
off the beaten path.  Britton watched the other
side closely.  The brilliance of the moon turned
the whole frozen expanse of country into a white
blanket, with here and there a soiled spot, which
was the dark-green of scrubby thickets.

The rush of frosty air bit the men's cheeks.
Odd little cadences, torn out of fleeting space,
whined shrilly in their ears.  White smoke of
dog-breath blew back in cloud patches to mingle
with the hoar of their own lungs.  The exhilarating,
electrifying flight through the Arctic atmosphere
made the blood rush with all its virility
through their lusty veins.

"We must be nearing Grand Ridge," Britton
said at last, in a low tone.  "Nothing has left
the trail on my side so far."

"*Non*," muttered Giraud, "she be de same on
dis side."

Britton was lying out as far as possible,
watching past the dogs as they swung down by
the little cache near the Ridge.  Suddenly he
uttered a half-suppressed exclamation.

"The rascal's left the trail here," he confided
to Pierre.  "Hold on; we're past it.  Rein in
your dogs.  There, off to the left!  That's his
track.  It leads down to the little cache.  I can
see something moving.  Maybe the beggar's
looting it, too."  He stood up, balancing himself
deftly in order to see the better.  Acting on a
swift impulse, he threw his hands up to his
mouth in trumpet-fashion and gave a loud hail.

"Hello!–the cache," he bawled.  "Who's
down there?"

An oath came back in answer.  There was a
scuttering through the snow, the frantic cracking
of a whip, whining of punished dogs, and the
desperate rush of a loaded sled.

"Caught red-handed!" roared Britton.  "Cut
him off, Pierre.  He's trying to make the beaten
trail."

Giraud whipped his dogs up, running at an
angle to the fugitive dog-train.  The plunderer
had reckoned badly in trying this mode of
escape.  His one team and laden sleigh struck
only a snail's pace compared with the speed of
Pierre's double team and empty sled.  The
voyageur's mad driving caught him before he
reached the main trail.  Whooping aloud, Pierre
drove his galloping animals right on top of the
other's dogs, anchoring them there in the loose
side-snow to snarl and battle in the traces.

Britton and the voyageur leaped off and made
for the piled-up packs on which the strange
driver was seated.  Realizing that he was thus
suddenly brought to bay, the fellow rose to his
feet and whirled the butt-end of his whip aloft.
"Stay back, curse you!" he cried.

"Better give in," Britton warned him.  "It's
best for you."  He jumped upon the rear bundles
of the sled.

A vicious blow of the whip was the answer,
but Rex was watchful.  He caught the descending
wrist, back-tripped the ruffian with a swift
leg movement, and choked resistance out of him.

"I think he'll be quiet now," he said to
Pierre.  "Strap his limbs.  That will do.  Let's
have a look at him."  The moonlight failed to
reveal much of the man's appearance except
that his face looked more like that of a beaten
dog than anything else.

"Smells like a distillery," Rex commented,
turning his nose away.  "He's been well primed
for this job."

"Were we tak' heem?" asked Pierre, more
material in thought.

Britton considered the matter for a short
moment.

"We'll have to take him back to Laurance's
and watch him by turns," he finally said.  "I
can pack the rascal on to Ainslie's Camp
to-morrow and collect my half of the reward from
Charlie Anderson.  He can pay you a like
amount on your return trip from Thirty Mile.
How does that suit?"

"*Bon*, for sure t'ing," Pierre returned.  "Ah
t'ink dat suit me bully.  Mak' de five hondred
ver' easy."

"Anderson will think it's well worth it for
the return of his goods with the gentleman on
top," observed Britton.  "Turn your outfit, and
I'll load this Whiskey-John into the empty
sleigh.  Whoa!  Easy–that's correct, *bon
camarade*!  Go ahead now.  I'll follow with the
contraband."

There was no jingle of bells, nothing but the
sober plunging of the sleds as the two dog-trains
filed back to Laurance's cabin on Indian River.

"So you've captured the condemned parasite!"
cried Jim Laurance, as the returning ones
reached his yard.

"*Certainement*! tam sure t'ing," Pierre assured
him, with a burst of good humor.  "Wat Ah
tell you?–we catch heem!  *Saprie*, yes–on de
leetle cache *par le* Grand Reedge–*n'est-ce-pas*,
Rex, *mon camarade*?"

"That's correct," laughed Britton, "we hit it
just right!  A little later and we should have had
a stern chase.  Make a jail, Laurance, to hold
the rascal."

"Roll him in by the stove," ordered Jim.  "He
won't give us any ha-ha.  I'll bet me best
mukluks on that."  Presently, as the man was taken
inside and the bonds loosed, he added: "Don't
calculate for a minnit you can vamoose–for you
truly can't.  Me Winchester'll stop such
tom-fool notions."  Laurance pointed to the
sinister-outlined rifle above the door.

When the light fell upon the captive's features,
the two men who had brought him in recoiled
involuntarily.

"*Le diable*!" hissed Giraud, as if some
hideously unpleasant truth were forcing its
utterance in spite of him.

"The devil!" echoed Britton; "that's it,
Pierre.  No more fitting description could be
given.  Look at the high cheekbones,
vulture-shaped features, and hellish eyes.  Good Lord,
Jim, did you ever see such an ugly man?"

Rex backed to a seat and began to divest himself
of his outer garments, all the while regarding
the cache-thief with critical eyes in which a light
of discovery was dawning.

"Looks like a cross 'tween a 'Frisco wharf-rat
and a Nome claim-jumper," Laurance averred.
"Say, mister, was you ever forty-second cook
round a scullery?–'cause you smells it!"

The captive vouchsafed no reply.  He sat with
his Satanic-shaped head buried between narrow
shoulders.  The firelight licked his face at
intervals, strengthening its horrible grotesqueness.

"W'iskey mak' heem talk," Pierre declared.
"Got de fire-wataire, M'sieu Laurance?"

"Yes," said Jim, "but it's too blasted dear to
waste on that trash.  I wouldn't give him Seattle
sas'priller.  Don't matter a crow-bait whether he
talks or not.  He'll get his own at Ainslie's to-morrer."

Britton came to the stove and gazed earnestly
at the huddled heap on the floor.

"Look up, man," he said roughly, but the
bloodshot eyes refused to meet his own.

"It's no use," Rex continued, with a cynical
laugh.  "I know you–Morris!"

The sudden revelation had its effect.  The man
sprang up with a snarl of rage.  His eyes
glittered malevolently–-straight into Britton's now.
He appeared about to fly at his captor's throat.

Pierre, ignorant of the cause of the thief's
sudden activity, likened him to a gaunt wolf at bay
before a big bull moose.  So the pair seemed.

"I think he will talk," Britton said slowly.
"He knows who I am now.  Yes–I think he will talk."

"D–d if I do," came from the thief.  The first
words he had spoken sounded like a husky's
gurgle when the collar nearly chokes him.

"Don't be so fast with denial," urged Britton,
smoothly.  "When you have heard the option,
perhaps your opinion will suddenly change."  He
looked at Laurance for an instant, debating with
himself.  The Klondiker was in a deep and
apparently uninterested silence.

"It's Morris, Jim!  Christopher Morris–the
man I spoke of, you remember?  His attitude
just now is suspicious.  I don't know how long
he has been in the Yukon, or what he is doing
here, but I cannot understand his present
escapade.  There's something behind it."  Britton
paused and allowed his keen, searching
glance to wander back to the repulsive figure of
Morris.

"I was about to give you an option," he
resumed.  "I think Laurance will second my
guarantee of a lightening of the punishment the
miners will hand out.  My proposition, in brief,
is this: Tell us what you know, what your game
is, who is behind you, and what is their object–tell
us this, I say, and you'll only be flogged
instead of hanged."

Britton's meaning came out clear and sharp
to the victim of drink.  He shivered a little and
pulled himself to his knees.  There was a hint of
supplication in the position, but this his captor
ignored.

Laurance coughed apologetically, in expiation
of his silence.

"You want to make sure of that?" he questioned.

"Yes," answered Rex.  "I know Morris
through and through.  In my long battle in the
courts I came to read the man like a book.  I
can sense his subtleties and under-purposes.  I
learned to do that, Jim, in the hardest school
of the world–the law-courts.  I am almost
certain that he is in league, or worse–in bondage.
Shall we guarantee him this?"

Laurance consulted his pipe for a long minute.
Then he flashed up his eyes in acquiescence.

"Go ahead!" he grunted.  "I guess we can
make it even with Anderson."

Britton confronted Morris once more, and
drove his words home with sledgehammer effect.

"Take your choice!" he said.  "Keep silent
and hang–you know they'll do it at Ainslie's–or
speak and get off with a flogging.  Which?
And be quick!  We want to sleep here.  Half the
night has already gone."

Morris, the derelict, instinctively felt himself
on the edge of things.  His wits were not yet so
liquor-dulled but that he could see the fate
awaiting him at the camp.  He knew the stern code
of the North–rough but effective.  Fortune had
played him a miserable turn, and, if he did not
catch at the proffered hope, she would sing his
death-knell, rollicking heartlessly.

He collapsed suddenly from his kneeling
posture and half lay on the rough floor within the
stove's circle of warmth.

"What do you want to know?" he asked doggedly.

"Are you prepared to speak plainly and
truthfully?  No lies, remember!"

"Yes, that is–"

"No parleying," roared Britton.  "I want
some sleep for the trail to-morrow.  You have to
tell all I want to know in five minutes or not at
all.  Ready?"  His words dropped bullet-like.

"Go on," Morris cried, with an assumption of
recklessness; "d–d if I care.  And hell take
the other fellow.  It's a case of life or death.
Open up, Britton!"

"When'd you come?"

"By boat last summer to Dyea and thence to Dawson."

"Wife with you?"  Britton's teeth ground over
the sentence.

"Yes," was the sneering answer.

"For what did you come?"

"Gold!"

Rex Britton laughed harshly.  "To be picked
up anywhere, anyhow!" was his comment.  "By
man and wife–mostly by the wife!"

His tone, however, changed to a cold, metallic
timbre when he asked:

"Who planned this cache game?"

"Simpson."

"Good heavens!–he's here, eh?  Still," with
another harsh laugh, "I might have known that
when your wife was in the vicinity."

Turning to Laurance, he explained: "Simpson
is a lawyer–counsel for Morris in the case
against me–and an especial friend of Mrs. Morris."

"What does Simpson want?" was his next
question to the tool.

"Money," said Morris.

"That's a lie," cried Britton, advancing
fiercely.  "He wanted the goods and supplies
for a purpose.  Money's procured by him in an
easier way.  But stampeders' supplies have no
pecuniary equivalent in Dawson now.  You see
there hasn't been a steamer up-river for long
enough.  They tell me Dawson has been lately
iron-bound.  Now let us know what Simpson was
going to do with the goods.  You'll swing if
you don't."

"He's going to prospect."

"Where?"

"On–on Samson Creek, where the rest are going."

"Big outfit for one man, isn't it?  The
contents of three caches!"  Britton's casual remark
held a taunt and a hidden meaning.

"He's taking men with him–to stake other
claims for him.  That's why–"

"Ah!  I see," Britton interrupted.  "When
does he leave?"

"Right away."

"Funny act, that," put in Laurance, with a
smile and wink.

"Yes," Rex agreed, the smile reflecting itself
on his wholesome face.  "Morris, you're only a
fool in this country, and you can't see much
significance in your statements.  I take the liberty
of telling you that there is a great significance in
those few words.  Old-timers have no difficulty
in seeing far.  Simpson, by the way, must have
become more rapidly acclimatized–or else he has
been at the game in other mining territories.
Pierre, what motive has the man who organizes
a toughs' stampede ahead of the spring rush to
ground which is partially staked?"

"He t'ink he joomp de claims," asserted Pierre,
promptly.  "Dat tam sure t'ing!"

Laurance laughed at the sudden start and
guilty shrinking of Morris.

"Why, a kid could spot that," the old
Klondiker assured him.  "Simpson, this law-juggler
as Britton speaks of, gets the nerve to jump
likely claims on Samson Creek.  It's just as well
he's found out.  If he had per-sum-veered he'd
surely got jumped hisself–at the jumpin'-off
station.  I'm certainly certain of that!
How-sum-do-ever, as me friend here goes vamoosin' into
Dawson shortly, he'll put a handspike in
Mr. Simpson's choo-choo gear."

Britton got up and shook himself as a great,
shaggy bear stretches its muscles.

"That's all for to-night," he yawned.  "The
saggy trail made me sleepy.  But take my advice,
Morris, and cut away from Simpson.  You're not
bound by ties unbreakable–yet you soon will be.
And that's saying a good deal if you stop to
analyze it.  Let's roll up, Pierre!"

"*Oui*," cried Giraud, slinging out the blankets.
"Ah dream w'at Ah get wit' dat five hondred."  In
the height of his buoyancy he broke forth in
song, and, while Britton dropped to sleep,
Pierre's voice rang up to the ceiling in the tune:

   |   "En roulant ma boule roulante,
   |   En roulant ma boule–
   |   Derrièr' chez-nous y-a-t-un 'ètang
   |   En roulant ma boule!"

   CHAPTER XI.

.. vspace:: 2

A great commotion stirred Ainslie's camp on
the following afternoon.  The narrow passages,
called streets, between ugly log and canvas
buildings were thronged with heterogeneous
concourses of miners and others.  They moved back
and forth along the pounded trail from restaurants
and stores to the bunk-houses, from bunk-houses
to dance-halls or riotous saloons, and an
air of expectancy pervaded the movements of
everyone within the camp's confines.

Outside Anderson's cabin the crowd began to
concentrate, talking in incessant murmurs, while
all eyes were fixed upon the closed door.  A trial
was going on inside.  The news had spread
through Ainslie's that the cache-thief had been
taken and was now up before a miners' meeting.
Word passed from man to man, and the throng
continually grew in volume.

Presently Anderson's door swung open.  Those
who had sat in tribunal poured out with the
prisoner in their midst.

Jim Laurance inhaled a deep breath and drew
the fur cap down over his damp brow as he
slouched along beside Rex Britton.

"That was a close thing," he growled.  "Don't
ast me no more to stick in me chin for a
slim-finger!  I don't much fancy these free-for-all
fights."

It was evident that the discussion inside had
waxed hot and that only a slender margin saved
the neck of Chris Morris.

The latter walked, with bent head, inside the
solid phalanx of grim miners, among whom burly
Charlie Anderson was chief.  The face of Morris
showed ashy gray in fear, and his eyes rolled back
like a negro's as he shambled along, gazing at the
ground, because the thought of looking for an
avenue of escape was worse than futile.

The waiting mass of people gave vent to
long-suppressed expectancy when Morris appeared.
A loud shout rose up, and everybody rushed after
the cordon which surrounded the cache-thief.  It
moved to the centre of the camp, where a large
hitching-post, bearing a red cloth sign advertising
Laggan's dance-hall, stood up at the side of the
winding trail that served for Main Street.

The impatient spectators ranged themselves in
lines that broke and shifted as they strove for
better vantage-ground.  Some, to obtain a clearer
view, ran and climbed upon the low roofs of the
log cabins, upon the verandah of the dance-hall,
and the porch of a store just opposite.  Women
were mixed in with the male gathering, some with
knee-length skirts and fringed leggings, and
others dressed outright in men's garments.

On every hand was unpitying condemnation
for the thief.  He was scowled at and spat upon,
for pillaging is considered the most contemptible
thing in the North.

When the cordon halted at the hitching-post,
Morris received a rude jostling from the crowd
till Charlie Anderson forced the encroachers aside.

"Lynch him!  Lynch him!" was the cry,
vociferated in a deep, guttural roar which made
Morris tremble.

Anderson shook his head and bellowed at the
bystanders.

"No, boys," he shouted, "we're going to do
as Laurance says and give him a chance.  Make
room, there!"

The sullen onlookers obeyed, leaving an open
spot at the post which held Morris and another
man, a thick-set fellow with a walrus-hide whip
in his hand.  Tense silence oppressed the
spectators, contrasting strikingly with their former
growls of impatience.

"Strip!" commanded the hard voice of Anderson.

Morris removed his outer coat, or parka, and a
woolen vest.

"Go on," was the curt order.

The buckskin shirt came off, and the thick
Arctic undergarment.  He stood, bare to the middle
against the cutting breeze, shaking from both
cold and fright.

"Now," said Anderson, nodding to the stout
man with the whip, before he stepped back among
the gaping people.

The man tied Morris to the post by his wrists,
took up a position four feet from the prisoner,
and applied the whining lash.

Half a dozen times it descended, flaying the
flesh, while not a sound arose from the crowd.
At the seventh stroke, Morris groaned, pitched
forward, and hung limply in his fetters.

"That's enough," cried Britton, vehemently.
"Can't you see he has fainted?"

A team of horses pulled up with a jangle of
bells in the trail.  Some woman's gauntlet, flying
through the frosty air, struck Rex a stinging
blow upon the cheek.

"Ho! ho!" laughed a coarse fellow at his
elbow, "so the Rose of the Yukon's down on you,
eh?  Or maybe it's a love-tap."

Rex looked between the disordered ranks of
roughly-clad miners straight into the flaming
eyes of Maud Morris, where she sat behind
Simpson's spanking grays, in Simpson's luxuriously
robed sleigh, beside the fur-coated, well-groomed
Simpson himself.

Her furious glance transfixed Britton and then
darted off, tangent-like, to the clamorous group
on his left, where three miners had revived Morris
with a stimulant and assisted him to an erect
posture.

The bare back of Chris Morris was a raw, red
patch, and he quivered convulsively as the sifting
hill-wind bit into the bleeding stripes, while his
custodians replaced shirts, vest, and parka upon
his body.

Maud Morris's second glove followed the first,
striking Britton rudely in the mouth.

"You beast!" she screamed impotently.  "This
is your doing, I hear!"

Rex ground the gauntlets into the beaten,
tobacco-stained snow under his feet.

"Be thankful that Morris lives," was his
heated answer.  "They swore he must swing and
fought against the commuting of his sentence.
It was a tight pinch, but Laurance and I
managed to pull it off at last."

The miners led Morris past and bade him take
the trail.

"Hit it fur the high places," they said, "an'
don't never show yer mug in this camp agin, or,
s'help us, we'll shoot ye like a dawg!"

It was justice, the stern, unsmoothed judgment
of the North, and Morris, the derelict who had
reached the lowest limit of his downward
tendencies, stumbled along the trail in the direction
of Dawson, a marked man in the eyes of all.

His wife by law looked to Britton as he had
last seen her in her boudoir at the big English
hotel on the Mustapha Supérieure in Algiers.
Her face was the same bright, hard mask of
hatred, and her soulless eyes burned.  He noted
that she was looking older, her stamp becoming
more brazen, her beauty lessening, because the
dust of fascination no longer blinded his vision.
The presence of the girl he had met by Indian
River dwelt in Britton's mind, a presence
moulded in a confusingly exact counterpart of
Maud Morris.  He remembered her fresh,
childish innocence and pretty modesty, and he knew
that in outward perfections alone the counterpart
equalled the original.  While he surveyed the
woman before him, he was certain that the
straightforward character of his unknown was
as different from Maud Morris's deceptive
disposition as chastity is different from shame.

The knowledge was very consoling to a heart
still void, and Britton wondered, with an
involuntary throb, if he would ever find the nameless
girl who had saved his life on the Indian River
ice-bridge.

"You look as if I were someone else with whom
you are genuinely pleased," Maud Morris said
savagely, shrewdly reading his expression.

Britton's whole countenance lighted as he smiled.

"Do I?" he asked pleasantly.  "That is
because I have found your superior!"

She bit her lip to check an unwomanly
expletive, and the mantling red in her cheeks gave
Britton full satisfaction.  He strode to Grant
Simpson's side of the sleigh and tapped the sleeve
of his rich, fur-lined overcoat.

"By the way, Simpson," he warned, "don't
try that game on Samson Creek.  It was quite a
frame-up you planned for those who have already
staked in, but Morris gave it all away."

Grant Simpson squirmed among the bear robes
in a startled fashion, and his thin, effeminate
face lost color.

"What do you mean?" he demanded, scanning
Britton narrowly.

"Only this–if you dare show your nose on
the Creek for any reason whatever, I'll tell the
miners things that will make them swing you
higher than Moosehide Mountain.  Of course,
Morris can't go in on any strike now.  They
wouldn't countenance it for a moment!"

Simpson's awe gave way to blind anger.  He
struck at Britton with his silver-mounted whip,
to find it promptly torn from his grasp.  Rex
touched the grays on the flanks with it, and the
team dashed down the Dawson trail with
Simpson sawing on their heads.  Britton laughed
harshly as they went, and slowly broke the whip
to bits.

"Simpson and Miss Vanderhart have given
the chump a lift," said a miner, watching in the
roadway.

Rex saw that the occupants of the sleigh had
taken up Morris and concealed him among the
fur robes.

"Who did you say?" he asked the miner.

"Simpson and Miss Vanderhart," the man
repeated.  "They're big guns at Dawson.  Know
them?"

Britton laughed again at the alias, as he
scattered the whip fragments with his toe.

"Yes," he said meditatively, "I know
something of them."

Just then Laurance swung out with his
dog-train, starting back to Indian River.

"I'm off, son," he cried to Britton.  "Are you
goin' to bolt for Dawson?  It's five hours from
here!"

Rex nodded at the sleigh, gliding leisurely
along the trail in the distance, and observed:

"I'll wait!  I'm not anxious for their company
on the route, and morning will suit me as well.
So she's the Rose of the Yukon!"

"Sure!" said Laurance, putting his dog-whip
in his armpit in order to light the inevitable pipe.
"Kind of romantic fiction, ain't it, to find she's
your angelic ideal?  Haw, haw!"

"She's not, for there's no bandage over my
eyes now," Britton declared, with conviction.
"But, by heaven, there is an ideal," he continued
in strange triumph evoked without volition, "and
I feel in my bones as if I'll meet that ideal some
time again."

"Um!" puffed Jim Laurance.  "Again?  Yes,
I may say again!  But take an old-timer's advice,
son, and see that you stick to one search at a
time.  You understand?"

"I couldn't forget that if I wished to," Britton
replied, smiling rather bitterly.  "I'm going up
Samson Creek at once.  If that search doesn't
prove worth while, there won't be any necessity
for the other."

Laurance gripped Britton's palm tightly,
saying: "You know where to come if stranded, son."

The negative motion of Britton's head showed
the pride that prompted his refusal; and
Laurance shook out his leader.

"Best luck!" he cried cheerily.

"For what?" Britton whimsically asked.

"For the gold and for–the–the other," Jim
Laurance called over his shoulder.  "Why,
d–n me, you deserve 'em both."

   CHAPTER XII.

.. vspace:: 2

Loping out of Ainslie's through the cold Arctic
dawn, Britton made Dawson under five hours.
Thanks to the recommendation of Charlie
Anderson, he was able to secure from an outfitter a
portion of the provisions that were being so
scrupulously reserved because famine threatened
in the distance with empty claws closing over the
golden city.

He did not run across Morris, his wife, or
Simpson, but he had the pleasure of eating
dinner in a restaurant run by Pierre Giraud's wife,
Aline.  The place was a neat, clean eating-house,
called the Half Moon, situated near the North
American Transportation & Trading Company's
store, and Pierre's wife proved to be a
bright-eyed, buxom woman, young and attractive after
the type of the French-Canadian maids.  Rex
thought it was the best meal he had had in a long
time, with the additional virtue of having a
dainty server, and he told Aline Giraud so.

"*Vraiment*," she cried, laughing gaily at his
praise, "M'sieu' ees reech in w'at you call–compleement!"

"Yes, but that is about the extent of my
riches," Rex chuckled, as he took his departure.

News of the Samson Creek find was freely
circulating in Dawson City.  Some claims had been
staked in the fall, and hazy descriptions of the
valley's wealth were in the air.  The Arctic
temperature of the Yukon winter kept many from
going out to locate, but a mysterious rumor arose
that there was a claim-jumping scheme afoot, and
Britton found that it had already travelled ahead
of him.  The rumor, quite indefinite in itself,
startled the people of Dawson from their
apathetic state.  Miners who had, at the approach of
frost, forsaken the valuable auriferous workings
for the city's beer-saloons drew on their meagre
stores of supplies and stampeded to their
holdings, ready to prove, even in gun-fights as a last
resort, that possession was not nine points but
the whole of the law.

Learning that so many prospectors had rushed
out the night before, Britton loaded his camp
stove, sleeping-bag, and tent upon his sled,
securely lashed on the provisions, consisting mainly
of bacon, beans, flour, and dried apples, and
made all haste away.

Samson Creek was a tributary of the famous
Eldorado, and on account of its proximity to
fully exploited fields offered great promise of
pay dirt.

Britton took the ice-trail up the frozen
Klondike, veered off to the right, and rounded the
great, cone-shaped, snow-laden mountain in
whose chasms the most noted gold streams,
including the Bonanza, have their origin.  He
travelled fast, unimpeded by snow-crust on the
white, glistening surface of the river, and on
nearing the south branch of the Samson,
overtook many who had started out before him.

"Got anything staked?" panted a miner, as
Britton went by.

"Not yet," Rex answered.

"Then you can't get in," the man said.

"Why?" Britton cried impatiently.

"Why?" echoed his informant.  "Ge-mima!–why?
Look there!"

They had topped the glacial slope of the
watershed and paused for breath upon the crest,
overlooking the creek's bed.  Britton beheld the
valley, freshly staked as far as his eye could reach,
with endless processions of men moving upstream.

"Get in?" said the miner.  "Not much!  I
must hike down and see nobody squats on the
claims I took last fall."

The man moved off, and Britton, angry
disappointment raging within him, stood and watched
the burden-bearing lines below.

Over on the west where the mountains bulked
up so huge and taciturn, the ruby sunset was
coloring the summits.  Dull, spotless snow-cornices
and shining ice-fields gleamed with rosy
hues that gradually deepened to rich crimson, as
if some Titan hand had poured over them a flood
of ancient wine.  The glacier tips scintillated
like the steel sabre-wall of a cavalry column, and
the scraggy hemlocks on the peaks quickened
with sapphire glints against their sober green.

Britton watched the magnificent panorama
hold its glory for some moments; then all turned
shaded and blue in a trice as a sheer rock
precipice capped the lens of the sun.

He turned away, dejectedly, toward the north
branch, remembering the hint of Franco Lessari,
the courier.  He crossed South Samson,
intercepting scores of men who mushed dog-teams,
dragged Yukon sleighs, or bore great loads on
their wet backs.  They strained in single file
up the beaten river-path–low-browed, cruel-looking
fellows who might have been thugs and who
cursed those that delayed them; eager-faced,
unbroken fools who had come in by steamer in the
heat of summer, housed themselves warmly in
Dawson when the frost fell, and had yet to
learn the smiting wrath of a Klondike blizzard;
luckless gamesters whom a winning turn never
blessed; and shrewd old pioneers, suspicious of
everyone, noting everything with keen,
wilderness-trained eyes, and pushing on indefatigably
to conserve their fall stakings.  Along the
sinuous river course heaps of boxes and sacks and
caches of food marked the journey; overweighting
baggage, thrown down to await more convenient
handling, blotched the ice with unsightly
disorder; discarded trifles, pack rubbish, and the
snarl of sleigh and tent ropes littered all the
route.

By dark Britton camped on North Samson,
four miles away.  There, for three days, he
burned holes in doubtful-looking gravel, enduring
uncomplainingly the manifold discomforts of
tent life with the mercury fifty below.

Meanwhile, the influx to the south continued,
and, all the explored stream being taken, the
overflow reached the northerly branch.  Rex
watched them come, more motley and dishevelled
than ever, unwilling to back-trail to Dawson and
yet with a secret dread gnawing at their hearts,
the fear of winter's lash whose torment the ache
of hunger might assist.  He saw them arrive,
as bitter and despairing as himself, and with
them staggered Franco Lessari, dragging the
most meagre of meagre outfits.

Lessari had no sleeping-bag, only blankets.
and thin ones at that; he did not carry a tent,
depending upon the snow hut dug in the river
drifts, and his food was a bag of coarse beans
and dried salmon.

"Ah," he cried delightedly, on seeing Britton,
sitting between his tent flaps, "you listened at
me?  But come to-morrow after me.  Where I
say, you dig!"

He was moving farther up-stream, but Rex
called him back.

"Look here," he began, full of commiseration
for the pathetic figure plainly in worse
circumstances than himself, "you might as well bunk
in beside me.  There's plenty of room in the
tent, and we'll prospect together wherever you
say.  If you're going to share a good thing with
me, I must make some return.  Come along!
Throw in your packs."

Gratitude showed in the Corsican's brown,
harrowed face as he wrestled with his limited
English vocabulary in the attempt to thank Britton
for the generous offer, of which he reluctantly
took advantage.

"You are so much kindness," he sighed repeatedly.

In the morning they shifted their camp another
mile up North Samson to a certain bend near an
icy ravine, called Grizzly Gulch, where, Lessari
said, a trapper had declared he had found good
gold-signs.  For three days more they burned out
the beach and excavated the frozen gravel without
success.  The trapper must have been mistaken, or
they had struck the wrong spot.  They branched
out with their operations and covered the dip
of the ravine in all directions, but their ill success
proved unvarying.

The bed of the gulley lay pock-marked with
burned holes, and the dump outside the tent grew
large.  It was after weeks of this trying toil that
Rex Britton discovered Lessari's one vice.

Rex came in one night from a late probing in
Grizzly Gulch to find an Indian of the
Thron-Diucks keeping company with the Corsican by
his camp stove.  Both men were joyously drunk,
and they hailed Britton as a welcome returned
prodigal.

The Thron-Diuck held up an empty bottle which
had, no doubt, been dearly bought from some
trafficking miner, and lamented the absence of
whiskey in woeful Indian jargon.  Lessari
jumped to his unsteady feet, attempting to
embrace Britton and dinning in his ears a hopelessly
mixed tale of gold.

"Gold, gold, gold!" he would cry, dancing
aside to pat the Indian on the back.  "Him tell
where gold for give him whiskey."

"Yes, Mis'r," the Thron-Diuck volunteered,
ingratiatingly.  "Give whiskey!  Me tell where big
gold come from–heap much gold."

Britton laughed mockingly.

"That tale's too old," he said.  "I've heard of
the combination of the drunken Indian, the bottle
of whiskey, and the golden valley ever since I
started on these cursed northern trails.  Now, if
you want to sleep by our fire, you'll have to stop
shouting.  I wouldn't turn a dog out upon a night
like this, but you must be quiet.  Understand?"

He made Lessari sit down, and kicked the
Indian's emptied bottle out of the tent.

"You'd sell your big gold pretty cheap," he
commented drily.

"Think me lie?" the vagrant cried aggressively.

Rex could see that he was at that stage peculiar
to red men's intoxication when they will sell their
bodies or souls to satisfy the abnormal craving
of their unbridled natures.  The whiskey's flame
licked through his veins, and there was no
checking the thirst for fire-water which only drunken
insensibility could satiate.

"I think you are imagining things," Rex replied,
"and I have no whiskey to spare in barter.
A mouthful of what you two wasted might have
been useful some time in saving a life in this
deadly cold."

"Me no lie," the muddled Indian persisted.

"You do," said Britton, with pointed sternness.

The Thron-Diuck's fingers fumbled in his rags
for an instant and came forth closed.

"Think me lie!" he shouted dramatically.
"Heap big gold–like that!"

From the Indian's extended palm, the yellow
flash of native gold filled Britton's startled eyes.

   CHAPTER XIII.

"Gold!  Gold!  Gold!" screamed the excitable
and drunken Corsican, as he danced about the tent.

At the bright gleam of the yellow metal, Rex
had sprung forward and grasped the precious
specimen from the Thron-Diuck's hand.

"Where did you get this?" he demanded,
breathlessly.

A look of cunning overspread the Indian's
coppery features, and discolored teeth were
displayed in his gaping grin.

"Give fire-water," he said, fawningly, "then
me tell."

Britton examined the piece of ore from every
angle in the candle-light and recognized a
wonderful sample of alluvial gold.  It weighed
probably eight ounces, and Rex trembled in
excitement not to be repressed.  There was no doubt
of its origin, and he knew that the carousing
rascal must be speaking the truth.  The glacier-worn
edges of the specimen told that it had come
from a heavy deposit, a place of "big gold."

"Where did you get this?" Rex hoarsely
repeated, his hands shaking as if weighted down
with golden pounds instead of ounces.

"Bring whiskey, then me tell where heap much
gold come from," was the Indian's laconic response.

"No, you won't," said Britton.  "You'll tell
first, and then you may have the fire-water."

He dived into a small kitty-bag wherein he kept
some few medicinal mixtures, whipped out the
solitary flask, which he was accustomed to carry
against a possible dire emergency of the rigorous
trails, and held it enticingly before the candle
flame.

The liquor sparkled in the light, and the poor
red wretch smacked his lips and clawed at it.
Rex held him off.

"Afterwards–afterwards," he said with decision.

"Ha!" exclaimed the tantalized Indian, "go
heap long way up the White River–"

"The Klondike?" interrupted Rex.

"Yes, as you call, Mis'r," answered the
Thron-Diuck, gesticulating frantically with lean, bony
fingers like talons.  "Go heap way up Klondike;
find ice-hills with much frozen springs; there big
gold where him be!"  His claws pointed at the
sample in Britton's fist.

"You mean the headwaters of the Klondike–its
source?" questioned Rex, earnestly.  "You're
sure of that?  For heaven's sake don't make any
mistake!"

The Indian shook his whole body and stamped
in anger.

"Me no mistake," he declared.  "Me no lie.
Go heap way up where you say, Mis'r, to–to–"

"To the headwaters," prompted Britton.

"Yes, to big chief waters!  There five hills
like heap big beaver houses all by one dam.
White River run through.  There place of heap
big gold!"

Rex wiped the beads of perspiration from his
forehead.

"This is the way I understand you," he said.
"Listen and tell me if I'm right!  The place lies
straight up the Klondike at its headwaters, right
in the middle of five beaver-house hills which the
stream cuts through.  Is that correct?"

"Right, heap right," replied the Thron-Diuck,
overjoyed at being properly understood.  He
reached for the whiskey again, but Britton was
not yet done.

"Wait till I draw a sketch," he said quickly,
"and you shall mark these hills in the exact
spot."

Rex found his map of the Klondike River in
his breast pocket and drew the stream on a larger
scale upon a sheet from a notebook.  At the
river's mouth was a deserted Indian village, lately
occupied by Thron-Diucks who had moved back
into the fastnesses of the snowy mountains, and
no other trace of habitation marked the frozen
waterway, which lost itself in bleak heights away
to the north, unexplored except by Indians and
a few venturesome white trappers.

"Now," said Britton, when he had outlined the
sketch, "show me exactly where these hills stand
from the source or headwaters of the river."

The Indian touched his talons to the drawing
just below a group of low mountains, named on
the map the Klondike Hills.

"How far below?" Rex questioned very earnestly.

"Half day, as you call, Mis'r," the Thron-Diuck
answered.  "Half day with heap good dogs!"

"So?" cried Britton, warming to the scent of
the treasure.  "How many hills on this side of
the stream?"

The Indian located three with as many dabs of
his skinny forefinger and showed where the other
two hills lay across the river.  Rex marked them
with small circles, mentally calculating by the
scale their distance from the source and thus
knowing their position at least approximately.

The Thron-Diuck regarded his handiwork with
satisfaction.

"Heap right," he said triumphantly, "Mis'r
heap smart man!  Give fire-water, Mis'r; you got
much big gold!"

Rex passed over the flask without further
parley.

"Yes, it's yours," was his final word, "but
heaven help you if you have deceived me as to
the position of this stuff!"

Lessari lurched forward to share the Indian's
draught, but Britton pushed him rudely back
upon his bed.

"You go right to sleep," he ordered, "and get
fit for the trail in the morning."

Rex sat beside him to enforce the obeyance of
the order till the Corsican dropped into slumber,
while over beside the camp stove the Thron-Diuck
lay in stupefaction.

The thermometer registered forty-eight below
when Britton and Lessari mushed out of the
North Samson valley at sunrise.  The Indian,
now partly sobered and conscious that he had
sold a well-guarded secret of his tribe, promptly
proceeded to efface himself despite the
inducements Britton offered him to act in the capacity
of guide, so that the two travelled alone.

As they advanced upon the lonely trail which
snaked northward to where the Klondike's
source was somewhere hidden in unknown hills,
the atmosphere grew keener with intense cold.
A merciless, cutting frost fell in fine showers till
the two men were covered with a hoary coating
which scintillated like glaring tinsel.  The icy
powder stopped their ears and choked their
nostrils, chilling every breath they took.

Lessari unfitted by his natural temperament
for such a climate as the Yukon, had always found
his respiration labored in winter, and, since he
had contracted a severe cold from his soaking
in Lake Bennett, his plight was now worse than ever.

Owing to the pressure on his chest he was
forced to breathe through the open mouth.
Britton pleaded with him not to do this, but the
finer fibred Corsican could not endure the strain
on his nasal passages and relapsed into breathing
between parted lips.  As a result, he soon chilled
his lungs and began to cough with a dry, hacking
sound which Rex heard with foreboding dread.

The mercury dropped lower with every mile
they mushed.  Icicles formed on their eyebrows,
noses and chins, while thin films of ice encased
their cheeks, prohibiting any speech.

A thickness of hoar-frost decorated the loaded
sled, and the hairy backs of the five dogs were
white with it.  At intervals they shook
themselves roughly in the harness, sending ice
particles flying in all directions.

Mingled with this rattle and the grinding song
of the sleigh was the leader's "gruff! gruff!" as
he blew the congealed snow from his nose.

Camp was made at noon outside an immense
ravine which Rex knew by hearsay to be the
great cañon of the Klondike.  After an hour's
rest and a good meal they entered it, finding a
precipitous-sided gorge of stupendous size and
beauty.

The gigantic gray walls, seamed and full of
wide cracks, sloped upward, forming an almost
complete arch overhead that admitted a dull glow
of light to mingle with the white sheen of the
ice below.  Great icicles hung by thousands from
the rock-crevices, while eternal drippings through
the cavern-like roof had formed immense ice
columns resembling unsmoothed marble pillars.

The scene before Britton and Lessari looked
like a weird, uncanny ice forest full of frozen
trunks and clammy, oozy nooks where
underworld spirits and grotesque goblins might be
expected to reside.  The hollow booming of the
mighty river, straining in its imprisonment, filled
the whole place with a resounding roar, and the
force of the fettered torrent shook the coated cave
walls till the icicles fell and scattered their
rainbow hues upon the floor.

Rex thought this cañon was the most potent
symbol of a potent land that could be imagined.
It impressed him vividly with the awesome
magnitude, the salient ruggedness, the terrible
power of the country of which it was an emblem.

His dog-train swayed with shrieking runners
among the massed ice-pillars and emerged from
the gorge into a wider valley where the hills rose
naturally bright in the sunshine with the welcome
blue sky resting upon their peaks.

Britton could see that the Klondike River was
the main recipient of the long trains of ice which
slid with snail-like motion from the crests of
the glaciers.  Frozen gullies full of these moving,
mile-long torrents broke in upon the larger river
and piled the junction points full of massive,
chaotic ice-bridges which were painfully difficult
to cross.

Lessari stumbled upon one huge jam and went
down among the sharp, crystal fragments.  He
gasped when he regained his feet, and the dry,
hacking cough became more convulsive.  Seeing
that he was nearly spent, Rex beckoned for a few
minutes' halt, though having hopes of reaching
mountainous shelter before nightfall, he did not
wish to delay very long.

While they rested on a high ice-bridge quite a
distance above the Klondike Cañon, they heard
a thin, hissing wail far back in its depths.

"Sled!" exclaimed the listening Corsican,
breaking into speech without thinking of the consequence.

At his effort the icy casing which covered his
cheeks snapped in showering splinters, gashing
the skin in a dozen places.  He groaned in pain
while the blood trickled down his face.

Britton thawed his mouth free by the warm
pressure of his fur gauntlets.

"You're right, Lessari," he said.  "It sounds
like a dog-train coming through the cañon.
Surely that cursed Indian hasn't been spreading
the news!  Or perhaps someone has trailed us
from Samson because they think we know of a
find up this way."

Britton's tone was angry as well as disappointed.
He had not undertaken the dangerous
and arduous trip up the Klondike for the purpose
of showing the way to some trailers who might
contest the ground with him.  If any rough
characters were following because they suspected he
had knowledge of a gold deposit, Rex knew he
would have to fight for what he found, and fight,
no doubt, with the odds against him.

"We'll wait and see who is tracking us," he
grimly observed to Lessari.

The whining sound of a dog-train continued,
borne through the cold void with clear persistence.
Rex strained his eyes on the distant mouth
of the cañon to mark who came out, but he
watched in vain.  The noise ceased as suddenly as
it arose, and though they dallied another fifteen
minutes, nothing could be seen.

"That's odd," commented Britton.  "Wasn't
it a dog-sled, Lessari?"

"Sound like him much!" answered the Corsican,
in an awed voice.  He was somewhat superstitious,
and he nursed his cut face apprehensively,
as if it were responsible for the strange
incident.

"I could have sworn to that as the shriek of
runners," Rex declared, "but it may have been
ice.  In any event we can't stop longer.
Ho! there–mush, mush!"

They forged on, climbing to a still higher
altitude and meeting with a frigid air that reached
to the very marrow of their bones.  Lessari
weakened, and Britton made him take to the sled for
the rest of the afternoon while he himself
continued his heart-breaking tramp beside the dogs,
surmounting all obstacles, no matter how
formidable, with that intrepid grit and unbroken
muscle-strength which was his heritage.

The short, sub-Arctic day closed in swiftly,
shrouding everything with a heavy fog, and night
caught the two travellers among the black river
boulders.

It was a desolate place of incomparable
bleakness in which they were forced to camp, but when
the stove was set going inside the pitched tent
and they had infused some heat into their
frost-tried bodies, the outlook seemed more cheerful.

The next day saw a repetition of their
hardships and trials.  Lessari declared himself strong
enough to keep his feet, but Britton forced him
to ride behind the dogs.  The Corsican lay
wrapped in robes, and the spasms of coughing
that wrenched his frame told about how fit he was
to travel the trail afoot.  There were places so
rough and so hard to scale that he could not
stay upon the loaded sled while the dogs dragged
it over.  At such points he was compelled to walk,
and Rex had to assist him.

They had penetrated into the timbered regions
which flanked the Klondike, and the way grew
wilder although there was some solace of shelter.
According to Britton's estimate of the Thron-Diuck's
directions the place of the five mountains
could not be many miles distant, and, even in
that soul-chilling waste, his blood warmed every
inch of his body when he thought success might
soon reward his strenuous stampedes.

With the reaching of the forested stretches,
grizzly tracks were seen in profusion, indicating
that these hungry prowlers were finding the
severe weather very hard, for they had covered
vast distances in search of food.

As they traversed mile after mile, making
rapid progress without hindrance of blistered ice,
Britton began to think that his hopes of camping
that night among the five beaver-house hills
would be realized.  Every time they rested for a
moment to give the dogs a breathing spell, he
eagerly scanned the sketch which he had made.
From the contour of the river and the position
of the mountains he tried to judge exactly how
far he had advanced.  Each scrutiny, thus
indulged in, gave fresh hope and assurance, and he
would dash on with greater speed than was
generally attained on the Fields.

The steep granite headlands gave place to more
sloping bluffs, and when Britton's dog-train
swept round the river's curve past the first long
belt of pine forest, there loomed at a probable
distance of six miles the tops of five hills set in a
circle.

"It's the place," he shouted joyfully.  "By
heaven, it's the place–Lessari!"

But Lessari, his endurance worn out by the
continual jolting, had rolled from the sled in a
dead faint.  He could not be revived easily, so
Britton had to pitch the tent, light a fire, and
attend to him.

The Corsican came to, weak and trembling, and
when Rex had given some nourishment, Lessari
looked at him with dazed, troubled eyes.

"I am much sorrow," he said confusedly.
"Your journey I spoil!  Put me on the sled, and
it somehow we can reach."

Britton felt a twinge of conscience for a
selfish wish as he heard these words from a man
who was courageous to the core though
obviously unable to continue.

"No," he gravely replied, "you haven't spoiled
the journey.  We can well rest here and go on
to-morrow.  Make your mind easy, Lessari!"

The Corsican, still lamenting the check to their
advance, fell into an exhausted sleep, while
Britton, the selfish desire recurring involuntarily
within him, chafed silently as he watched from a
distance the peaks of his far-sought gold Mecca.

   CHAPTER XIV.

.. vspace:: 2

Five dead dogs, their stark bodies clearly
outlined on the snow by a sparkling aurora,
met Britton's startled gaze when he stumbled
sleepily out of the cramped quarters of the tent.
A cry of something like despair escaped him as he
ran to examine them, turning the gaunt carcasses
over and over.

Lessari heard the shout of perturbation and
shuffled forth from under the flaps.

"What wrong have you?" he asked anxiously.

Rex stood aside and showed the corpses of their
faithful animals.

"They're killed," he said briefly, "and you
know what that means for us!"

White horror grew in the Corsican's brown
face till it was blanched to a sickly hue.  He fully
realized that the loss of the dog-team had buried
them alive in a frozen wilderness whose relentless
cruelty would slowly crush their lives.  In
a dazed way, he fingered the bodies.

"Not any marks–not any marks," was his
vacant observation.

"No," agreed Britton, who controlled himself
with difficulty, "they have been neither knifed
nor shot, yet some man's hand has done it.
Gaucho and the rest of the huskies appeared as
well last night as they ever did.  No, Lessari, it
wasn't an epidemic or even the bitter frost."

"How they are killed, then?" the Corsican
inquired petulantly.

"That's the mystery," Rex woefully ruminated,
aloud.  "I wonder if that snake of a Thron-Diuck
followed us and perpetrated this deed!  You
remember we heard what we thought was a dog-train
coming behind us through the Klondike Cañon?"

"Ah! yes," responded his companion, "that I
recall–curse him!"  Lessari's eyes were vindictive
and full of a strange wildness as he stared
at Britton.

"Of course that is only a supposition," said
Rex, judicially, "but I know how jealous the
Indian tribes are of gold-laden creeks.  The
Thron-Diucks know a good many secrets, but
they will not divulge them, and fearing the wrath
of his fellows if we located on this deposit, the
red wretch may have repented his bargain and
taken steps to prevent our profiting by it."

"Look for tracks!" exclaimed the Corsican, on
sudden inspiration, but Britton shook his head.

"No use," he lamented, pointing to the
pine-banked curve of the river, shining like glass,
"the ice is too clean!"

"Curse him!  Curse him!" exploded Lessari,
again, growing more violent of speech.

"There's no use in cursing, either," Britton
said seriously.  "We're facing death, Lessari,
but we must keep alive as long as possible.  We
have a tent and some food, and we'll make a
strong fight."

The Corsican studied his dubious expression.
"Go back?" he asked.

"It can't be done," said Rex.  "Our provisions
will not last half the time required to make the
journey on foot, and there is nothing to shoot
over those barren stretches."

"Go on where gold is, then?" Lessari inquired
dismally.

"Yes," Britton answered, "our path lies over
those five hills.  We have only two chances,
Lessari, and they are mighty slim!  There is the
chance of stumbling on the encampment of these
Thron-Diuck Indians–they have retired somewhere
in these mountains–and the possibility of
finding game in the pine forests.  The way lies
yonder, and, if we find gold there, we'll stake it
in case a miracle should bring us out of this trap."

Rex stirred the nose of his dead leader with the
toe of his shoepack as he finished speaking, and
Lessari saw him bend quickly.

"See that!" Britton exclaimed in quivering
anger.  He held out something between his
fingers, and the Corsican recognized a piece of
frozen whitefish covered with reddish powder.

"Poisoned!" he ejaculated with renewed horror.

"Yes, someone has fed them poisoned whitefish,"
said Rex, vehemently.  "Gaucho had this
in his teeth!"

Lessari broke out in a flood of denunciation.
Britton quelled his own indignation and began
untying the tent-ropes.

They thawed their canvas shelter from the
banked ice and snow by means of several brush
fires and loaded the sled.  Any articles which
could be dispensed with and which unnecessarily
impeded them were cast away.  The outfit was
reduced to a minimum, and Rex packed all the
remaining provisions carefully in one large sack.
He preserved, too, the food intended for the dogs,
for he thought they might easily find themselves
in such straits as to be glad of it.

When all was securely lashed on the heavy
Yukon sleigh, the two men harnessed themselves
in the traces and started laboriously toward the
circle of hills six miles away.  For Lessari, they
were six long and excruciating miles.  He was
weak and unfit, and though Britton took the
heavier portion of the toil, the tramp told rapidly
on his companion.

The river curved with such a sweep that they
struck overland to shorten the distance.  They
bridged wide gullies full of blistered ice and
swerved erratically with the loaded sled among
rugged rocks and slippery hummocks that barred
their path.  Lessari continued to mutter and
complain during the whole six miles, his mumblings
toward the end becoming somewhat incoherent.

When they slipped down a long ravine which
opened on the river right in the middle of the
circling hills, the Corsican was staggering along
with protruding tongue.

"You're fagged!" Rex exclaimed, noticing his
plight.  "Better rest here a minute!"

Lessari's answer was a vicious pull on the
sleigh rope that nearly took Britton off his feet.
They moved on because the Corsican would
accept no delay, and Rex saw that the other's
motive power was a sort of delirium which
instilled unlimited feverish energy.

The pair of toilers emerged at last from the
black rift and climbed an ice-capped ridge which
fell like a sloping watershed in a southward
direction.  Around them the five beaver-house
mountains rose strangely dome-like, the great
river apparently losing itself in the bowels of
the thousand ice chasms which furrowed the base
of the valley-beds.

"This is the Klondike's source," Rex
murmured as he contemplated the scene, "and it
looks cold enough to kill you."

"Yes," sighed Lessari, "you have it right.
But the gold–the gold is warm.  Here I feel
it!"  He put his hand to his breast, and smiled
contentedly.

"It's all that's keeping you warm," Rex
gruffly commented.  The observation quickly
altered Lessari's expression, and he glared with
a wild impenetrable look as they proceeded to
skirt the fringing line of gravelled granite which
was the shore of the now glacier-like stream.

Here the detached ice lay scattered about in
huge blocks, an impediment to their feet, where
it had glided with the shining rubble from the
farther plateaus.  In the shallow cup that the
five hills formed, they met with a long,
treacherous crevasse whose yawning depth of three
hundred feet effectually cut off any further
progress in a direct line.  The great abyss seemed to
possess a fascination for Lessari, and he trod
dangerously near the edge to peer over.

"Don't do that!" Britton sharply cautioned,
pulling him back.  "A slip of your moccasin
would put you at the bottom.  We'll have to
leave the sled here and see if there is any way
round!"

The immense crevasse dipped from an overhanging
glacier on one of the five mountains and
slanted across the granite ridge they had been
skirting.  The two men left the Yukon sleigh
standing, blocked, above the deep split and
followed along the edge, searching for a place to
cross.  The slant of the ravine became more,
acute, and, where the sides were jagged and
shelved, they clambered down lower and lower
till the whole formation suddenly broke upon a
vast cavern that nosed into the river-bed and
opened on the other side where the way was
passable though extremely hard.

"It's rough going, but we must get across,"
Rex said, turning round to Lessari.

The latter was handling some rusty-looking
pebbles which he had kicked out of the black
cavern floorway.

"Ironstone!" he grunted scornfully, gazing at
the cave side where similar fragments with
glacier-worn edges stuck out.

"Let me see," cried Britton, hastily jumping
forward.  Lessari dropped the stones in his hand,
and Britton's heart leaped at the weight of them.

"Ironstone!" he exclaimed, his voice all
trembling.  "My God, Lessari, it's gold!"

"Santa Virgin!" the Corsican screamed–"Gold!"  He
snatched frantically at the precious
pebbles, chattering madly.

"I'm positive it is," Rex said excitedly, "but
the flame-test will soon tell."

He produced a bit of candle from his coat and
lit it with unsteady fingers.  While Lessari held
the specimens, he applied the flame to them.  The
heat singed the Corsican's hands, but he did not
seem to feel any pain.  Presently the rusty red
covering of the pebbles disappeared as fine dust
in the blaze, and Lessari gripped pure alluvial gold.

"Santa Virgin!" he screamed again.  "We're
rich!  We're rich!"

Rex was off immediately, running about the
cavern walls, making a hasty survey with his
candle end.  The walls, like the floor, were
studded here and there with peeping corners of
the precious ore for which he had endured two
thousand miles of pitiless Yukon trails.
Unbounded wealth lay within his grasp, and, with
the triumph of the moment, he forgot that he was
a millionaire in a death-trap.

"Go up for a spade, Lessari," he cried.  "It
is a mighty deposit–'big gold,' as the Thron-Diuck said."

The Corsican started up as a faint, rushing
noise sounded above, like ice sliding upon ice.

"What's that?" asked Britton anxiously.

They listened, but heard no further echo.  Rex
appeared ill at ease.

"We're among glaciers, Lessari," he said,
"and we must be careful.  An avalanche might
easily bury us in a hole like this.  Get that shovel
quickly!"

Lessari climbed up the lip of the ravine and
disappeared, while Britton pottered about,
speculating, as well as exulting, over the
magnificent find.  It was a showing that gave promise
of surpassing such far-famed creeks as the
Eldorado and Bonanza, and Rex gloated over his
prospects.  Standing in that deep cavern under the
Klondike's bed, his thoughts went back to the
green Sussex lands, Hyde Park in the London
season, and the foaming Channel swells under the
*Mottisfont's* bows.  He thought of the estates
this buried gold would buy, the power it would
bring, the restoration to public favor it would
effect, and he laughed mirthlessly at the idea of
purchasing his way into quarters of society and
diplomacy which had closed their doors to him
after his Algerian escapade.

A shrill cry from Lessari above interrupted
his cogitations.  He scrambled out of the cavern
and clawed his way up the slippery side of the rift.

The Corsican was staring down into the abyss
where they had left the sled.  On his face there
rested a look of terrified bewilderment, and he
pointed into the gloomy depths.

"Gone!" he wailed–"gone down!"

Britton looked around for the sleigh, but it
had vanished.  A sharp fear assailed him as he
dashed to Lessari's side and saw the mark of the
runners on the powdered edge of the ravine
where the laden sled had taken the leap.

"That's what we heard slide," Rex groaned,
"and it has all our food!"

He went mechanically to the exact spot where
the Yukon sleigh had stood.  There lay the piece
of granite which had blocked the runners, with
the print of a husky's foot-pad in a minute
snow-pocket at its side.  Rex showed it to the Corsican,
a swift, ominous wrath mantling his countenance.

"By heaven, Lessari, this is too much!" he
cried.  "It has been done purposely like–like the
poison!  There's a hand in the dark somewhere,
and it means murder!"

The Corsican's harrowed senses appeared
incapable of comprehending the statement.

"Starving–and rich!" he muttered wildly.
"Rich–and starving!"  He walked without fear
to the brink of the chasm and began to lower
himself over the rock with his hands.

"Here!" Rex roared in terror, rushing up.
"What do you mean?"

"Stay back!" snarled the Corsican.  "I go
down to eat."

"The gold has turned your head!" Britton
exclaimed.  "You couldn't get down there for all
the food on earth.  Why, man, it's three hundred
feet!"  He sprang with a lithe movement and
dragged the Corsican from his perilous position.

Lessari gave an inhuman cry and closed with
Britton.  Rex saw his eyes as they struggled and
knew, with a feeling of chill horror, that they
were the eyes of a madman.

"Ha!" gasped the demented fellow.  "This
time you go!"

He strove to throw Britton into the gulf, for
resistance had resulted in giving his mania a
different trend.  The delirium gave him the
strength of six men, and Rex found himself being
gradually pushed into the crevasse.  He strained
and tugged with all the mighty power of his
shoulders and corded arms, but it was of no
avail against the frenzied Lessari.  He tried
another tack!

"Cool yourself, Lessari," he said soothingly,
"and we'll get this sled."  They could never get
it, but he hoped the artifice might serve!  Even
that attempt at reason proved useless, for the
Corsican redoubled his efforts.  The eternal cold,
his illness, the death of the dogs, the fever of the
gold-finding, and the loss of their provisions had
all combined to drive him mad.

"Devil!" he screamed, "you threw the food
down!"  And Rex knew he was indeed demented.

Fighting every inch of the way, Britton was
forced toward the abyss.  Three feet from it,
he felt the necessity for desperate action.
Watching his opportunity, he tripped Lessari on the
iced rock, and they both fell heavily.  Rex wound
his arms about the Corsican, putting forth the
last ounce of strength; that grip of steel would
have held a giant, but it could not hold a
madman.  Lessari tore himself free and gained the
uppermost position, with hands on Britton's throat.

Rex gazed into the rolling eyes, the wild,
distorted visage of the Corsican, and felt himself
shoved to the very brink of the crevasse.  He
wrenched violently at Lessari's wrists and arms,
but they were as iron rods, and the movement
brought his head out over the rim of the rock.

In one fleeting vision he saw the white, rising
ice-fields cutting into the blue sky, with
glacier-capped peaks banking up behind; he saw three
of the five circling hills, their frozen gorges
shining emerald in the sun; then, as Lessari's wolfish
face came closer to his own and his arms were
pressed down, the fingers felt the revolver butt in
his belt.

In sheer despair he grasped it as a drowning
man snatches at an oar.  Its report cracked out
and rattled in a hundred blatant echoes down the
gorge.  Lessari uttered a gasping groan and
lurched to one side, his fingers lax and weak.

Britton wormed his shoulders back from the
edge of the abyss, shifting the Corsican's weight
with his legs, and arose in safety.  His lungs
were heaving with the tremendous strain like
those of a spent Channel-swimmer, and the cords
of his throat were taut.

When he turned over the limp form at his feet,
he looked into Lessari's dead face.

   CHAPTER XV.

.. vspace:: 2

Back in Dawson, on the evening of the same
day when Britton stood alone with the awful
Klondike solitude at the edge of Five Mountain
Gulch–as it came to be named afterwards–when
he faced at once the icy phantom Cold, the
grisly skeleton Starvation, and the devil-faced
thing Remorse, when he halted with death at his
feet and its dread power pervading the desolate
snows about him, there occurred, in the golden
city, a strikingly different scene, a scene
palpitating with warmth and life.

A group of men, present at Grant Simpson's
invitation, occupied one of the ground-floor
rooms of the Half Moon restaurant, engaged
ostensibly in doing justice to a very elegant and
costly supper, but really killing time in a
luxurious way and waiting anxiously for the bell-note
of business which they knew their host intended
to ring in on them.

Simpson, with his accustomed lavish expenditure,
had engaged the room to the utter exclusion
of other guests who might have dined at two
of the three tables which the chamber held; he
had ordered that the trio of tables be lined up
and converted into one long feasting board which
could be covered with fine viands and
drinks–principally drinks!  The catering was let to the
hostess of the Half Moon, Aline Giraud, who was
a genius of management, all the more so since
Pierre's absence on the trails left every
responsibility in her hands.  That night she expected
him back from the completion of his
baggage-freighting contract with Laverdale, the big
American mine-owner who was bound for Dyea
and the States, and Aline wished to have
everything right.  She wished the supper that this
well-dressed, money-burning lawyer was giving
to be a thing beyond criticism, and her every
effort was devoted to making it so.

And the bill!  She told herself the bill would
be the best of it all.  It would be a thing to cheer
Pierre's heart and cause him to dance, with his
cap thrown among the ceiling festoons.

Simpson's was the dominating figure of the
company present in the room of the Half Moon
where Aline Giraud served so assiduously with
her alert, graceful movements and her full, white
arms.  He seemed to hold the key to some
enterprise which claimed the attention of all under
their masks of good fellowship, but Simpson did
not yet consider the moment propitious for the
unfolding of hidden plans.

He sat at the head of his table, with his guests
ranged in two lines on either side, men well
known in Dawson, the chief characteristic of
whom was money.  That was why they were
present!  If they had not had money to invest, they
could have entered into no proposition with
Simpson.

Jarmand, the fat, wealthy broker with the
currant-roll neck and the oily insolence, was there;
Fripps, the sour, thin, anæmic promoter,
maintained his usual unobtrusive but nevertheless
certain presence; a trio of capitalists of a
somewhat similar stamp, keen-visaged but
rotund-bodied, quelled their impatience successfully,
while they secretly chafed at Simpson's dalliance,
and awaited his proposition.  These men were
inseparable in any business prospect; they
worked together, invested together, and stood or
fell by a triumvirate judgment; and since their
names began with the same letter–Cranwell,
Crowdon, and Carr–they had been dubbed the
three C's.

Where the three C's went in, the financial
project need not be strictly legitimate.  They had
few scruples or qualms, and when they took hold
of a mining scheme or a real estate deal, wise men
kept out.

There were others present, probably a dozen
in all, and among them Jim Laurance, who had
come with a great deal of misgiving and
scepticism on receipt of a letter from Simpson advising
him of an opportunity of getting in on the ground
floor right under the scoops of a dredging proposition.

And in preparation for his demonstration of
ideas and plans, Grant Simpson bade them all
enjoy themselves, setting the example himself
with a free hand on the ladle of the punch bowl.
Many followed his example from appetite; the
three C's imitated, thinking of a relished business
dessert as a sort of solace.

Famine might be threatening in the land of
gold, but she had certainly no embargo on liquors
and cigars.  Both were indulged in without stint.

Blue, acrid wreaths of smoke filled the room,
and the atmosphere became very warm.  No one
would have guessed it was forty below in the
street, The two lines of guests at the table and
the host at its head emptied glasses and refilled,
tossed them off and ladled up again.  Small talk
hummed, and jests cracked out, more or less
coarse in the intervals when pretty Aline Giraud
was absent from the room during the different
courses of the meal.

Jim Laurance, the only temperate one in the
company, sipped his simple glass of punch
sparingly, refusing the bottled stuff and the heavy
wines.  He felt disgusted and sorry that he had
come, but he had money to invest if Simpson's
thing suited him, and he settled himself to sit
out the revel.

The roadhouse at Indian River had proved a
good thing for Laurance.  He had struck his
Klondike right on that creek, and he was sane
enough to know it.  Instead of frittering away
his coin on fool stampedes in hopes of a mighty
strike, he was satisfied to invest it in sound
mining securities and watch the dividends slowly
grow.  Such an enterprise, he hoped, was in
Simpson's mind.

Simpson's wine, however, was more in
Simpson's thoughts than the enterprise.  He had
unwisely glutted his taste for beverages with a
tang, and he lost control of his manners as well
as his senses, laughing boisterously and telling
unsavory tales.

"Hi, there!" he would yell, skidding the empty
punch-bowl down the table to Jarmand.  "Fill
her up, Fatty.  You're the doctor.  Put in
something stiff–stiff enough to make your moustache
stand!  Something d–d stiff, Fatty!"

"That's it, Jarmand," gurgled Bonneaves, a
young profligate and an especial chum of
Simpson's.  "Mix us a regular old hair-raiser.  We're
out for fun!  Who's holding us down?"

"No one!  No one!" shouted three or four of
the muddled men, stamping on the floor and
breaking into confused singing, which set up
rumbling echoes through the other parts of the
restaurant and went far to disturbing its customers.

"Tell us a story, Simp," said Jarmand.  "Old
Simp's the boy for spicy ones.  Eh, men?  You
bet your liver-colored notes he is.  Rip one off,
Simp, there's a good fellow!"

Accordingly Simp ripped one off, a story that
convulsed the drinkers but which made Laurance's
blood boil.  The one-time plainsman, now
an Alaskan sourdough, sat very still, without the
shadow of a smile upon his face.

Aline Giraud, accompanied by a waitress, an
ugly, angular Danish woman, brought in the
meats.  These were bear steaks, slices of moose
flank, and grouse in pairs, a veritable feast which
would have fed a hundred poverty-pinched
wretches in the outlying camps.  The thought
came to Laurance as he poised his knife and fork
over the breast of a fat grouse dressed with sage
dressing in a wonderful brown gravy.

"Seems hard to waste this here," he said
simply, "when there's so many poor cusses
starvin' round the Fields."

"To h–l with them!" cried Simpson, roughly.
"What we have, we got.  Eh?  We pay for it,
and when you pay your way, the rest can go and
be d–d to 'em.  How's that?"

"Right," nodded Bonneaves.  "You're always
right, Simp.  You're a wise old buck.  Glad I've
known you.  You can show a fellow things.
Here's to you, Simp!"

The talk grew louder and looser.  As the
gravies were being served, Simpson and Jarmand,
exchanging winks, attempted a double surprise.
The lawyer made a bungling effort to kiss Aline
Giraud on the cheek, while at the same time the
fat broker leaned forward and pecked at the
waitress.  The result was a startling surprise for
Jarmand.  The ham-like hand of the Danish
woman descended with a resounding smack on
the currant-roll neck of the broker.

The seated company roared at Jarmand.  Jim
Laurance frowned at Simpson and half rose from
his chair, but Aline had succeeded in eluding
the lawyer and fled through the doorway, the
angry red showing in her cheeks.

"That's one on you, Fatty," tittered his friends.
"Beautiful throw-down, that!  Right place, too!
Like another, Fatty?  Better try again.  Ho! ho!"

"Cheer up, old man," laughed Simpson,
accepting the joke.  "Better luck next time.
Walk into the punch there, Fatty; you have a
weak heart."

They walked into the punch till the third bowl
failed to withstand the charges, and a fourth
had to be mixed.  Some of the men, unable to
restrain their vivacity, arose and capered about
the laden table, singing and playing the fool
perfectly, and stopping only to refill empty tumblers.

The Danish waitress, now secure in the triumph
of her first quick victory, held her ground
undaunted, completing the serving of the banquet
in spite of the noise.  Aline, no longer entering
the room, watched the progress of things through
the doorway from the farther chamber.  Somehow,
this fine supper over which she had spent
so much effort had not turned out as she had
contemplated; things were getting beyond her grasp;
her eyes grew anxious wide, and startled.

After all, she thought, it might not please
Pierre.  Even the bill would never compensate
for the disgusting clamor and the humiliation.

Laurance had finished his single glass of punch
and was drawing on his short, black pipe.  He
disdained the long, fat cigars of Jarmand and
the three C's, and cursed the ill-smelling,
coronet-banded cigarettes of Simpson and
Bonneaves.  The oddest figure in the group himself,
he felt nothing but contempt for the others.  The
only thing about them he respected was the
business instinct of their sober moments, and there
seemed but little chance for a display of that now.

The Alaskan waited till the fourth bowl of
punch ran low, hoping that Simpson would open
his mouth to speak sound sense, instead of
salacious nonsense, and tell them why he had invited
them to supper, but when the concoction of a
fifth bowl was begun, amid most uproarious
hilarity, Laurance inwardly fumed, making up his
mind that he would not sit there much longer.

Unconsciously, he was frowning through the
drifting haze of smoke at his companions.  There
was no stern decorum present, nor any nicety of
attire.  To be sure, Simpson, as host, and
Bonneaves, to imitate his model, wore dinner clothes,
but the rest were dressed in the ordinary dress
which occupation demanded.  The three C's
were in black broadcloth; Jarmand sported a
suit of loud check pattern; Fripps favored grey,
as wrinkled and faded as his skin.  The others
of the company were mostly mining men who had
come in corduroys, with trousers stuffed in
knee-high cruisers, and had hung fur coats and caps on
the pegs behind their chairs.  Laurance, travelling
by dog-train to Dawson, wore the musher's
outfit of the trails.

He looked rough and uncouth, but very much
a man.  His beard was disreputable as ever; the
iron-gray hair stood up stiffer and stubbier,
allowing his rat ears to be seen; his nose peeped
out, cherry-red and snub.  He was lowering on
the foolish antics of the rest of the men, and his
keen blue eyes were narrowed so much that they
did not flash.

"What's the matter with you, Laurance, old
sport?" cried Bonneaves, joyously.  "Look as if
you'd buried your best friend in the punch-bowl!"

"Why," shouted Simpson, "if that's so, we'll
resurrect him!  Resurrect's the word, boys.
Eh?  How's that?"  He seized the bowl in both
arms and emptied it to the last drop in the array
of glasses.  Then he turned the dish upside down
on the table and hammered upon its bottom,
while the company roared as if he had done some
extremely witty thing.

"What say, Laurance?" asked young Bonneaves.
"Feel any better?"

"I feel like twistin' your cussed neck, young
man," answered Laurance, wrathfully.  "What
did I come here for?  To eat a decent meal an'
talk business!  I didn't come to swill meself–I'm
certainly certain of that!  We're men anyhow,
an' there's no call for us to act like a lot of
calf youngsters as can't pull the draw-string on
their gullets.  I say we're here to talk business!"

"H–l, yes," grunted Bonneaves, with the air
of sudden recollection.  "You're right, sport,
now I come to remember.  Simp did bring us
here for a purpose, and that's no lie.  Give us
your scheme, Simp.  Hot and heavy and
fast–that's the way!"

Because their tastes palled a little, the others
added their clamorous entreaties.  Their
exhortations made a confused babel:

"Hit it up, Simp!  Uncork your oracle.
Spread yourself quick, old boy.  What's the tune
now?  Time we talked, by gad!"  And Bonneaves
nodded sagely at Laurance, muttering:
"You're all right, sport.  Simp's a wise buck, but
you're a wiser!  See?  Attention, you duffers!"  He
secured order by pounding the board with
the thick bottom of his tumbler.

"Simp's going to spout," he announced
authoritatively.  Noticing that the lawyer had
engrossed himself with the opening of a champagne
bottle, Bonneaves hastily added: "Why, no!
Rat me if he isn't going to swallow!  Here, Simp,
that won't do.  Put it away.  Can't you see your
friends are waiting?"

"I'm busy," protested Simpson, struggling
with the cork.  "It's all about that Yukon
dredging business anyhow.  I've taken it off
Morris's hands since he's played the fool and
disappeared, d–n him!  I need backing.  That's
what I need.  I can't go it alone!"

"What's the lay-out?" prompted Jarmand.
"Put aside the bottle and get down to business."

Simpson flung away the opener as a useless
thing and grasped a fresh one.

"Curse the bottle and curse the business," he
fumed.  "I'm busy, I tell you.  Here, I have
the prospectus.  Read it yourselves, and you'll
save my wind!"  He drew some typewritten
sheets from his breast-pocket and flung them
upon the cloth.

What he had called the prospectus passed down
the line at one side of the table, up again, and
down the other side, greeted with grunts of
approval by those still clear-brained enough to
understand and with much head-wagging from
such as were incapable of comprehension.

"Bully!"

"Standard bred!"

"Up to snuff!"

"Neat as garters!"

These were some of the comments from the
appreciative assembly.

Last of all, the prospectus came to Jim Laurance.
At the top of the sheet, in large typing,
was the name, "Yukon Dredging Company."  Underneath
that reposed the list of directors,
picked, apparently, from the group invited to
supper.  Jarmand's name appeared, and Fripps's,
Bonneaves's, and the names of the three C's.

Laurance quietly read the sheets through, with
their significance vitally impressing itself on him,
and when he finished, he saw that he held the
kind of thing which is circulated by thousands
through the mails for the catching of suckers.
It was the universally familiar, folded sheet that
expounded the virtues of the greatest dredging
proposition in the world.

"By gad," he cried, angrily shaking the
prospectus in the air, "so this is what you've hauled
me over here to back up, eh?  A cussed, dirty,
widow-an'-orphan robbin' swindle, if you ast me!
An', gents, I give it to you straight: you're a pack
of low faro dealers, a bunch of thimbleriggers, a
handful of flimflammers if you put through that
there deal.  You're a ring of thieves and d–d
blacklegs, gents!"

"Hold on there, sport!" yelled Bonneaves.
"You go it too strong.  We won't stand for all that."

"I can go lots stronger yet, young cocky-neck,"
warned Lawrence.  "Why, I ain't half goin'.  You
should see me fizz some time, me son, an' you'd
run your feet off for fear of bein' blowed up."  He
regarded the youthful profligate grimly,
shaking his stubby scalp and gray beard aggressively,
but in the corners of his eyes there lurked a
humorous expression.

"Aren't you in on this?" asked Jarmand,
rolling a wave of his oily insolence down the table
to Laurance.  "Aren't you taking hold?  There's
money in it!"

The Alaskan eyed him squarely.

"Not the kind of money I want," he said
severely.  "Not me own kind, by a thousand
yard shot!  I don't want no widow's mites or
orphan's pennies; I don't steal no wimmen's
savin's nor the hard-earned dollars of some poor
laborin' cuss as thinks the Yukon is one whoppin'
lump of gold an' all we got to do here is to file
up our finger-nails and claw it off in pieces.  No,
sir, count me out!  An' I'll see some law-sharp
an' have you gents counted out, too.  You don't
work this here game so easy.  I'm certainly
certain of that!  You can't rob people so d–d
bare-faced.  No, sir, you truly can't.  Why, this here
would be wors'n jumpin' all the claims on
Samson Creek!"

Laurance's glance rested full on Grant Simpson
as he uttered his bold words, and the lawyer
looked up with suspicious, drink-steeped eyes.

"What the devil's wrong with this thing?" he
demanded angrily.  "What puts your back up?"

"Look here," snapped Laurance, pointing to
the typewritten sheet.  "You claim to have one
hundred miles river frontage, or 'bout ten
thousand acres, on Indian Creek.  You bought it
from the Government!  Pretty lie, if you ast me!
Clear title from them, and all the rest of the
high-falutin's!  Pah!–it turns me sick.  For you
haven't a yard–not one d–d yard.  I'm there,
an' I know!"

The Alaskan's vehemence drew the attention
of everyone, drunk or sober.

"An' you have two dredges at work, expectin'
a third," he went on, continuing to read from the
prospectus.  "That's a crackin' good Sunday
paper joke.  What does it mean?"

"Well," growled Simpson, "we will have.  We
intend to."

"The devil you do," said Laurance.  "You'll
put the money in your pocket an' keep it there.
To h–l with your prospectus!"  He tore the
sheets in half and threw the fragments on the
floor.

Simpson laughed.  He viewed the whole affair
with colossal unconcern.  In its time he could
proceed with the venture at immense gain to
himself and the others.  It must be postponed, in
spite of it being the reason for the assembly,
because, just now, wine was a much more important thing.

"You don't have to plunge," he commented.
"Stay out if you can't like it."

"Yes, but he doesn't need to give us extra
work," interposed Jarmand, expostulating about
the torn prospectus.

"Have an ice, Laurance."  advised young
Bonneaves.  "It'll cool you down."

"I'll have nothin'," Laurance growled, reaching
for his coat.  "I don't hanker after suppin'
with them as I now know is thieves."

At the host's call, the Danish waitress brought
in the ices on a tray, while Jim Laurance muffled
himself in his coat.

"Where's Aline?" Simpson asked, assuming
the privilege of familiarity.

"My mistress?" said the waitress.  "She will
serve no more.  She will not enter."

"But she'll have to," cried Simpson, flushing
with anger and obstinacy.  "Tell her to run in
and serve immediately or I shall come after her
and kiss both her cheeks instead of one."

The Danish woman flounced out, and Jarmand
involuntarily put his fingers to his fat neck.

"You see," explained Simpson, "it isn't like
as if I hadn't paid her for the supper and for
occupying her room.  And, by the way, this isn't
the only room!"  He nodded and laughed evilly,
adding: "The hubby's on the trails."

Laurance's coat went off his back with a
reverse of the motion which was putting it on.
The garment flew into one corner, and the owner's
voice rang out across the room like the clank of
good steel.

"By heaven, Simpson," he roared, "you can't
throw one speck of mud on Pierre's wife.  You'll
eat dirt for it.  You're a d–d dago-hearted liar!"

Laurance sprang along behind the row of
chairs to reach Simpson at the table's head, but
a hand caught his elbow as he passed the side
door and whirled him about.  With the suddenness
of an apparition, he saw Pierre, in musher's
dress, fresh from the trails, filling the entrance
with his bulk, so that the white face of Aline had
to peer under the arm which held Laurance back.

"Dis for me, *camarade*," murmured Pierre,
pushing the Alaskan behind him.

Giraud then walked quickly past the astonished
men till he stood in front of Simpson.  Very
deliberately he gazed at him.

"M'sieu'," he said, "you wan coward.  You
wan dam coward!"  And his open palms gave
Simpson a stinging blow on either cheek.

The lawyer lashed out with both hands and
feet, but Pierre grasped him by the throat and
shook him like a long rag.  Bedlam broke loose!
Chairs and tables were overturned as the
half-dazed revellers jumped up.  Aline's screams
were mingled with the crash of glass and
chinaware.  Jarmand, Bonneaves, and two or three
more of Simpson's friends rushed to his
assistance, bent on violence toward Pierre, but Jim
Laurance swung on them sharply, with eight
inches of blued, cylindrical steel glittering in
either hand.

"Back there," he yelled, "every man-jack of
you, or I'll plug you with these gas-pipes!"

The glinting light on the dull, ugly Colts
daunted them no more than the determined
gleam in the eyes of the man behind.  The
rescuers fell aside like gale-blown gravel and
remained glued to the wall.

Pierre Giraud set the lawyer on his feet.  The
voyageur's face was pale and rigid.

"M'sieu'," he said, "you lak wan feather in my
hand.  Ah no be go fight wit' you dat way, 'cause
dat not be fair.  *Mais* you geeve Aline wan
insult–de wors' insult dat man could geeve!
An' Aline, she lak wan leetle w'ite saint.
M'sieu'," and he tapped Simpson's shoulder,
"wan of us be keel here.  Ah keel you, fair, or
you keel me.  Tak' de choice of dose!"  He
indicated Laurance's pistols.

It was no orthodox duel.  There occurred no
pacing, no arrangement, no seconding, no
counting!  Laurance put one weapon in Simpson's
hand, whipped the other over to Giraud, and
stepped between the door-jambs, screening the
thing from Aline.

Abruptly the shooting began, the revolvers
spurting jets of flame through the blue haze of
the room, whose atmosphere thickened into
swirling wreaths with every report.

It was a scene of the wildest disorder, with the
overturned tables and chairs and shattered glass
below; lights above, swaying to the explosions
of the pistols; at the sides the lines of awed yet
excited men flattened against the walls; the
anxious Laurance and the frantic, white-faced wife
in the side entrance; guests fleeing from the
other parts of the establishment with shrieks and
clamor; and in the centre of it all the two
combatants manoeuvring in the mist of smoke to
avoid being hit, advancing and firing swiftly as
they advanced.

Simpson shot the faster, with wild, deadly,
malevolent hatred; Giraud directed his weapon with
slower deliberateness, ruled by one earnest,
avenging impulse.  The room rocked to the
deafening reverberations of the pistols; the bullets
went pang-panging on the wainscoting; the jets
of flame turned to crossed spears stabbing
through the smoke.

In ten seconds the men were within gun-reach
in the centre of the floor.  Simpson's sixth ball
broke the skin on his opponent's neck, but
Giraud's fifth went hurtling through the lawyer's
brain.

Simpson sagged in a little heap of black tuxedo
and white starch, his brow stained with spurting
red.  Aline Giraud was sobbing on Pierre's
breast, but Laurance roused him roughly to an
acceptance of realities.

"Hit it, an' hit it quick!" Jim urged
vociferously.  "The Mounted will be here on the run
in a minnit.  Gad, that firin' must wake up the
whole town.  Where's the dog-train?  Is it unhitched?"

"*Non*," answered Pierre, speaking like a man
in a dream, "she be in de yard lak Ah left her."

"Come on, then," whispered Laurance, pulling
him out.

Aline clung to him piteously, and Pierre
embraced her with a swift, despairing, passionate
gesture.  Then he put her from him with an
effort that was agony.

"He'll come back," consoled Laurance, "as
soon as this blows over.  Come on, Pierre.  I
hear runnin'."

They were gone on the instant, leaving Aline
Giraud with her sweet, white face upturned in
prayer and her hands clasped in an attitude of
fear, parting, and renunciation.

When the uniformed men of the Mounted
Police filled the room where Simpson lay dead,
Pierre was galloping his dog-team at full speed
up the ice-trail of the Klondike.

"Hit it for the Thron-Diuck camps," Laurance
had advised.  "They're somewhere in them
mountains.  An' lie low till I send you word by
an Indian."

That was how Pierre, heading for the
Thron-Diuck encampments near the Klondike's source,
found Rex Britton four days later, half dead
from starvation and exposure, with his last
burned match in his pocket, ravings on his
tongue and delirium in his brain, about fifteen
miles from Five Mountain Gulch.

"Sergeant, this is the devil's own country!"
exclaimed Cyril Ainsworth, as he stood outside
the Mounted Police post at the head of Lake
Bennett.

Sergeant Church laughed heartily.  It was
late spring and just about the worst time for
mosquitoes and black-flies.

"Your introduction to the country hasn't been
an exactly pleasant one," he replied, "but it is
better than the winter."

"I can't see why men will bury themselves
here," the lawyer complained, "especially a man
like Britton!"

"He struck it rich," Church said.  "He's
worth two millions.  Yes, Britton's one of
Dawson's big guns now!"

"That's no reason for remaining coffined,"
Ainsworth snapped.  "Why doesn't he come
back to England and live a civilized life?  Then
we would know where to find him when he is
wanted, without crossing an ocean and a
continent and traversing a God-forsaken wilderness
as big as the motherland!"

A constable of the post came up from the lake.

"The canoe's ready, sir," he reported, with a
salute.

Ainsworth and Sergeant Church moved toward
the shore.  The lawyer had come in over the
summer trail from Dyea, the White Pass Railway
from Skagway to Lake Bennett being as yet only
a talked-of project, and his many experiences
had been not altogether comforting ones.

"It is a pity you cannot wait for the steamer,"
Church observed.  "Canoe travelling is very
hard when one is not accustomed to it."

"D–n the steamer!" exploded Ainsworth.  "I
am told that these boats run weeks behind their
schedules.  What use is that to a man on urgent
business?  You inhabit a devil of a country, sir."

Sergeant Church laughed again, wondering
silently how Ainsworth's system and precision
would avail against the numerous unforeseen
contingencies of that broad Northland.

They reached the landing, where a thirty-foot
Peterborough waited in care of two brawny
Chilcoot men, named Dave and Pete, who had lost the
other sections of their respective cognomens,
along with their former identities, somewhere in
the place of long trails.

The canoe was a roomy one, moderately fast,
and fairly light on the portage, a necessity for
the Dawson trip.  Pete trimmed the packs in it
very carefully so as to give fine balance when he
should take the stern, with Dave in the bow and
their passenger between them.

"We put in the canned stuff an' the fly grease,"
volunteered Dave, with a sly wink at Sergeant
Church.

The sergeant pulled furiously at his moustache
to hide a smile, and mumbled some comment on
the adverse wind over Lake Bennett.

The grizzled Pete, meanwhile, was scrutinizing
Ainsworth's legs with an unappreciative eye.
The lawyer had thought that English riding
breeches would be a very suitable thing for
roughing it on the canoe trip, and had donned a
tightly-cut pair, together with the accompanying
leggings.

"They'll git down the leggin' an' clean through
them pants," Pete sagely observed.

"What?" asked Ainsworth.

"The flies," answered Pete, "they'll make
mosquito-nettin' of them leg-o'-muttons.  Git some
overalls an' cruisers if you don't want to be
drilled like a honeycomb."

Ainsworth recognized the wisdom of this
advice, even if he resented its criticism, and went
back to the post with Church.  When he
appeared again, he was attired in eighteen-inch
cruisers, tough duck overalls, and flannel shirt
with vest, to keep the bloodthirsty black-flies
from stabbing through.

"You look some Christian-like," commented
Pete, in a low tone.  Then aloud he added:
"You're fit to fight them black divils now!  Let's
hit her up!"

They did hit it up over Bennett, with Sergeant
Church waving them farewell from the post.

Ainsworth had never been in a canoe, having
ridden a ten-ton barge down from Linderman,
and the apparent unstability of the craft appalled
him, though he took particular pains to conceal
his concern.  It required considerable effort to
preserve an unruffled mien, and Pete noticed that
the lawyer's white fingers gripped the gunwale
like a vise.  Lake Bennett offered a thirty-mile
pull, and with every mile the blustering
headwind increased till it blew a smothering gale.

"This ain't no tug-boat," Pete growled, at last.
"Git out yon extra paddle."

Ainsworth gasped.  He had not expected that
he would be ordered to help with the locomotion
when he was paying his men ten dollars each a
day and a bonus if they landed him in Dawson
by the date upon which it was necessary for him
to be there in Britton's interests.  He began to
wish he had waited for the steamer, and he made
a mild protest to the grizzled stern paddler.

"This isn't in the bargain," he said confidently.

"No, nor this sea ain't in the bargain,"
returned Pete.  "Paddle, durn you!  Do you want
to git swamped?"

The big, swinging waves drenched them, and
Ainsworth fell to work with the extra paddle.
They made some headway thus, though the
lawyer had to alternately paddle and bail, but the
gale grew worse and forced them to creep along
the shore.

There the three men fought the squall, wading
in the shallow water and pulling and shoving their
canoe through the pounding surf.  It was Ainsworth's
first baptism, and the gods of the north
had conspired to make it thorough enough.

That night they camped on Cariboo Crossing
amid the black-flies and mosquitoes.  These made
a specialty of dining upon Ainsworth.  He was a
tender, fresh cheechako, much more inviting than
the leathern-skinned, calloused sourdoughs, Dave
and Pete.

While the Chilcoot men pitched the tent,
Ainsworth batted the flies.  They came in ravenous
swarms, bent upon participating in a treat, and
Ainsworth wrapped Cariboo Crossing and its
environment in a haze of sulphurous expressions.
Because he was in shelter where the wind could
not reach them, the black pests covered his face
and neck; they drifted from the thickets like
mist wracks and made the camping hour
unbearable for the lawyer.

Presently, however, Pete had the stringing of
the tent all finished; had anchored the ends,
ballasted the sides, and banked it about with moss
to keep out the pests at night.  Then, as Dave
made a couch of pulled boughs for their
passenger, he built a smoky fire.

"Git in that," he said to the lawyer.  "It'll
fix 'em."

Ainsworth found to his satisfaction that the
dense smudge relieved him of his winged assailants.
He stood in it so long that Pete, smiling
to himself, built another fire, upon which he
cooked bannocks and fried fish caught in the lake.

They ate their evening meal, protected by the
smoke, and Ainsworth, lying back with lighted
pipe, watching Pete bake flapjacks for the next
day, experienced a comfortable, soothing
sensation.  The long twilight of the Northland died,
and the dark marched over Bennett.  Upon the
clean rock they had picked as a camping place
their twin fires shone with a ruddy glow against
the dark green of the shrubbery and blocked out
their canvas like some giant white moth among
the bushes.

Northern insects and lizards sang and crooned
in voices strange to Ainsworth; strange noises
of the darkness echoed and ceased; the stars
wheeled slowly, and the crimson camp blaze
faded to amber coals.

"Put your head under the blanket an' keep her
there," was Pete's warning, as they turned in.

Ainsworth tried to obey, but decided that the
observance of such a decree would result in
suffocation.  He preferred to endure agony and
live, for though the tent had been well prepared,
it was impossible to keep out all the mosquitoes.

They sang in falsetto choruses above the
sleepers' heads.  Dave and Pete could hear the
lawyer's stifled imprecations and vicious slappings
till slumber overpowered them.

By morning Ainsworth was pretty well chewed,
and stupid with loss of sleep.  He bathed in the
lake water while the others got breakfast, but
the experiment was painful.  The flies feasted
on him while he undressed, whenever his head
and shoulders rose above the surface, and when
he dressed again.  It seemed that they
recognized no intermissions and countenanced no
union hours.

On Tagish Lake an exasperating headwind
baffled the canoeists as on the preceding
day.  Ainsworth soon caught the swing of the
paddle, and his blade flickered and dipped in time
with those of the steerer and the bowman.

Striking the sweep of the rolling waves, he had
to bail until they could no longer make any
advance.  Along the shoreline they went
overboard, Dave hauling ahead with the towline,
while the lawyer and Pete pushed on the canoe
through the nasty breakers.  Hour by hour they
struggled strenuously and unceasingly, the surf
soaking them to their necks.  Ainsworth did not
like it, but the wet was better than flies.

A halt was made at Tagish Post for rest and
recuperation, after which they pushed on with
more favorable weather through Lake Marsh and
reached the head of Box Cañon.  The strip of
water between it and the foot of White Horse
Rapids is treacherously bad, so they portaged
where they could not line, and skirted the famous
chutes.

Five Finger Rapids gave them a tough
struggle, and snags capsized them twice, but they
accomplished the descent on the third attempt and
entered deep river water.  Here the current
ran tremendously strong, and only where they
could not tow did they use the paddles.  Towing
was heart-breaking work, the ragged undergrowth,
splintered rocks, and bays, necessitating
ugly wading, proving drains on their strength.
They fought the racing currents with the short,
snappy Indian stroke and drove through swirling
whirlpools, called eddies, at the expense of all
their reserve power.  At the Police post on the
Big Salmon they slept like dead men, and started
late the next day.

The rest of the canoe route into Dawson was
not so trying.  They made up some lost time and
reached Dawson City on the date Ainsworth had
set as the limit within which he had promised the
bonus.

"You win, men," Ainsworth said, as their trim
craft rocked in the swell of a steamer which had
just cast off her shore-lines when they neared the
wharf.

"We do, sure," grunted Pete, with a
complacent smile.  "When we calculate on doin'
somethin' by a set time, it's generally done, ain't
it, Dave?"

"It is, sure," Dave agreed, his interest being
more attracted by the bustle on the landing than
the discussion of what they had done.

The bank was lined with Dawson's inhabitants,
for the boat service was the most vital part of
their existence, and their attention hung on the
arrival or departure of every steamer.  A mixed
assemblage covered the small dock, and in it were
Indians, traders, capitalists, prospectors,
dog-mushers, and women.  The boat itself carried a
number of passengers, and a great cargo of
outgoing baggage and freight littered its decks.  The
big paddle-wheels churned fiercely in the stream,
and a dinning clamor of farewell rose up from
those on the shore as the Yukon boat swung with
the middle current.

The Peterborough took the place alongside the
wharf which the steamer had vacated, and the
three occupants at once became objects of inspection.

"Hullo, Dave!  Hullo, Pete!" their friends
among the crowd greeted.

"Where ye bin?" asked Old Jim Parsons, a
famous and ancient musher.  "Bin sort o'
travellin' some, hain't ye?"

"Runnin' against time," Pete grinned, "an'
we win!  Where's that big gun you call Britton?"

"Gone down the river just afore ye come,"
answered a voice in the throng.  "Seen him take
his canoe!  He ain't gone more'n five minutes."

"Ah!" mused Ainsworth, "so he doesn't ride
in a launch now!"

Old Jim Parsons shuffled his feet irritably on
the landing.

"Launch!" he ejaculated in high scorn.
"Don't ye know he's the best blade on the river?
No dod-blasted sputter-boat fur him!"

The old musher's snort of indignation followed
them down the stream, and Ainsworth chuckled
in a satisfied manner.  After all, a man who
preferred his canoe to a launch was man enough
to listen to sound reason.

They ran upon him suddenly in a little bay
some distance down stream.  He had paddled
easily, being out for an evening hour, and beached
his canoe on the shingle of a half-submerged river
bar.  He sat upon a rock at the water's edge,
smoking and looking into the depths.

As they approached, Ainsworth discerned
another figure near Britton.

"He's not alone," he commented.  "Do you
know the person who is with him?"

Pete stared under his hand, for the evening
sun slanted over the wooded ridge with a
dazzling glare which prevented easy vision.

"No, by gad," he said in a loud whisper, "fur
it wears skirts!"

The bowman was startled, and his brown palm
also shaded his dark eyes.

"It does, sure," Dave gasped.  His serenity
was so disturbed that, he thumped the gunwale
with the paddle grip.

"Blast you," snarled the outraged Pete, "do
you want him to think we're a pair of bloomin'
skiff-rowers?"  Dave subsided in discomfiture
at the deserved reprimand.

Britton had caught the thump, and looked up.

"Ye gods," he cried, "a miracle!  A miracle
has come to pass!"  Beneath his flippancy there
ran a vibrant tone of delight.

"Yes, a miracle of exertion!" Ainsworth
asserted.  "I've undertaken a cursed journey for
your sake, Britton; I have been pounded,
devoured, and drowned in the effort to get here by
the thirtieth of July.  Take my word for it that
I don't want another similar trip.  It has been
a devilish task.  Ask the men!"

"It has, sure," the Chilcoot men said in one
voice, without waiting to be questioned.

The Peterborough had drawn in close to the
perpendicular rock upon which Rex Britton sat,
and they could not then see the woman who was
sitting on the lower beach near the other canoe
where it rested on the bar.

"And why this haste, O prophet?" Britton
laughed.  "And why this trip, at all?"

"When a man buries himself alive and his
resurrection becomes necessary, someone has to
attend to that rising," Ainsworth said.  "The
someone is very often his legal adviser!"

Britton smiled with a touch of tenderness.
He loved Ainsworth for his odd, swift manners of
action and speech and for his unalterable fidelity.
An inkling of the trend of events had come to
him, but he could not show it, and Ainsworth's
solicitude was comforting.

"Still, I am completely in the dark," he persisted.

"Then you haven't much perception," the
lawyer growled.  "The Honorable Oliver Britton
is dead, and he has left you Britton Hall!"

Rex sprang upright on the rock in his astonishment;
then laughed shortly, as he resumed his
seat, stuffing nervously at his pipe.

"That won't go down," he observed sardonically.
"I remember what my uncle said to me
that last night in Sussex."

Ainsworth leaned out of the packs in the
middle of the canoe, speaking in an eager,
intense voice.

"Can I read testaments?" he asked.  "Do I
know law?"

"As none other in England," Rex replied softly.

"Then believe what I have told you," the
lawyer said.  "I play with no one, and I wish no
one to play with me.  Your uncle died last month
of pneumonia.  Britton Hall is willed to you!"

Rex thrust a muscle-wrapped arm over the
rock.  "Come up," he said, "and tell me all
about it.  Tell me what they are doing at home.
How's Trascott and–and the old place?"  His
eyes were alight because the sea-girt downs of
Sussex still had a spell for him.

Ainsworth stood up carefully in the centre
of the Peterborough while his men balanced it
against the granite with flattened paddles.  He
put the toe of one scarred cruiser in a crack of
the perpendicular wall, and grasping the
outstretched hand, he was lifted to a seat beside
Britton.

"Trascott's fine," the lawyer said, "and the
old place is as green as ever.  We both had a
grand run over it with the hounds just before
your uncle was stricken.  The fox was started in
that bit of furze by Bowley Creek, where we used
to snare rabbits when you were a kid and I was
proud of my 'teens,' and went away with the
pack in full cry over Cranston Ridge.

"A good many of the hunters came croppers
at that marshy brook and high hedge fence, but
Trascott and I stuck on with the best of them.
We were first in at the finish beyond Bramfell
Heath, and we got the brush."

"It must have been a good run," Rex breathed.
"I can see every stick and stone of it now.  Yes,
I could ride it blindfold if I were back there."

The lawyer put his hand on Britton's thick,
brown arm.

"You're going back with me," he said calmly.
"It's not a matter of desire but a case of
responsibility; yet if you would rather follow desire,
there are enough attractions over home.

"Who wouldn't want to be lord of the finest
estate in the county?  Then there is the
yacht–it goes to you–and the stables of hunters and
polo ponies; there is the London mansion which
is part of the property; the pheasants are a prime
lot, and the trout streams have been lately
stocked."

Ainsworth paused to let stirring memories
work their effect.

"And the responsibility?" Britton asked after
a moment's silence.

"That clinches things," Ainsworth declared.
"It is incumbent upon you to fitly fill your
uncle's place.  They want you back home!  The
servants are awaiting their young master; the
cricketers and polo players have you already on
the teams; the sailors rejoice because you will
command them; hostesses all over the county
have sent me social invitations in view of your
return to England.  You must go back, Britton,
for the sake of the Britton name.  You must
perpetuate the name and the lineage!"

The lawyer became so earnest that he gestured
with his arms in an unaccustomed fashion, while
Rex gazed thoughtfully at the broad river swirls
laving the white shore-line and spraying
overhanging bushes.  The sun showed a half disc of
crimson above a distant bluff, sending a last
flood of ruddy light over the spot where the two
friends reclined; below them the tired Chilcoot
paddlers nodded in their motionless craft lying
close against the seamed wall of ironstone; the
curve of the rock shoulder still hid the woman,
who had not moved from the beach.

"Suppose I don't go back," ventured Britton,
dreamingly.

"If you don't, it all goes to the auctioneer's
block.  Your uncle put a condition and a date in
his will.  You either take possession within two
months or they sell the estate for charity."

Rex sprang up a second time, spurred by
Ainsworth's announcement.

"Sell Britton Hall!" he cried.  "By my soul,
they had better not think of it.  I would come
from the grave to prevent that!"

"Thank the Lord," breathed Ainsworth, in
immense relief.  "I haven't labored in vain!"

He arose also and seized Britton's hand.
"Swear on this handshake!" he ordered, and
Rex took the vow.

"Now that you have promised, I can tell you
something else," the lawyer observed.  "I am
glad that I did not have to use it as a means
of influencing you.  Boy, listen!  They want you
to represent New Shoreham."

Ainsworth made the declaration with a tinge
of paternal pride.

"They want me!" Britton exclaimed.  "I
couldn't do it.  I–why–"

"Never mind," interrupted his friend, "I know
your objections by heart, the depreciation of your
abilities and all the rest of it.  Let that pass,
and give ear to common sense!  The community
of New Shoreham has gone from bad to worse
since Oliver Britton chucked its representation
for the diplomatic service.  The name of Britton
was a power there with the lower classes and the
aristocracy alike, but during the last few years,
its want has been felt.  The place has been torn
by political strife, rival factions, and unscrupulous
candidates.

"They want a Britton to lead them again.
After your uncle's retirement, the big men
pleaded with him to enter the arena once more,
and I believe he would have yielded to their
entreaties had death spared him.

"Now they clamor for you in his stead.  Only
a Britton will satisfy them.  Commercial
interest as well as political prosperity hangs on that
name.  Don't offer refusal!  I won't hear of it;
Trascott will not listen to it; and no member of
the place can bear its mention."

Ainsworth's vehemence wakened the paddlers,
and they slapped the water idly with their blades.
The crimson disc of the sun had vanished.  The
river surface changed to a perfect violet hue.

"It's a big thing," said Britton, slowly–"tremendously
big, and it has come like a Bennett wind!"

"The day of nomination is the same date that
your uncle fixed for the condition of taking
possession," Ainsworth remarked.  "Thus there
was a double reason for my haste, and the
reasons still hold.  We must make a start for home
immediately.  Delays may arise, and we can't
run the thing too fine."

Rex knocked the dead tobacco from his pipe
on the heel of his prospecting boot.

"Yes," he mused, "we'll go back to the downs,
but my comprehension is still slow."

"If you serve well, they'll put the word
'Honorable' before your name," his friend commenced
in a lighter vein.  "Then you know there's the
daughter of the Duchess!  You used to be sweet
on her when you were attending Oxford."

Britton started suddenly at a recollection,
though not at the one Ainsworth had prompted,
and looked toward the river bar.

"Yes, tell me what the woman is doing there,"
the lawyer begged, following his glance.  "I
have refrained from asking any questions."

"She is painting a sunset scene," Rex replied
in a hard, overstrained tone.  "She likes to be
quite alone when sketching."

Then he called out: "Mercia!  Have you finished?"

"One moment, Rex," a bell-like voice answered
from the shingle.  "I am nearly through."

"Let us go down," Britton suggested, offering
no explanation as to who the lady was.

They crunched down upon the gravel, and mental
association of an unconscious variety brought
Ainsworth the remembrance of another woman,
the woman who had come across their course at
Algiers.

"Where are Maud Morris, her husband, and
Simpson?" he asked.

"Maud Morris is in Dawson," Britton replied.
"The other two are dead."

"Dead!" echoed the lawyer, in genuine amazement.

"Yes," said Rex, "Morris succumbed from
drink and exposure at Samson Creek two days
ago.  He had taken some winter side-trip which
was too much for his constitution.  They said
his wife had the decency to go to him on his death-bed."

"And Simpson?" eagerly inquired Ainsworth.

"Pierre Giraud shot him for insulting
Giraud's wife, last winter."

"Jove!" exclaimed the lawyer.  "Your North
believes in swift justice.  What was done with
the voyageur?"

"He escaped to the wilds," Rex said, "but
returned later, and was arrested by the Mounted
Police."

Ainsworth indulged in no comment because
they had reached the woman painter.  She
turned, smiling, at their footsteps, and the
lawyer stared dazedly at the image of Maud
Morris.

"Mercia," said Britton, "this is Ainsworth,
the friend of whom I have so often spoken.
Ainsworth, let me present my wife!"

The beautiful, girlish figure held out her hand,
but the lawyer recoiled, glancing angrily at Rex.

"What trick is this?" he cried, but when he
studied the sweet face before him again, his
senses received a shock.

He bent forward, using his keen eyes more
searchingly, and surveyed her with a scrutiny
well nigh rude.  It gradually dawned on him that
this was not Maud Morris but someone moulded
in her likeness with a purer, intensified beauty.

"Forgive me, forgive me!" he burst out
impetuously.  "I mistook you for a woman who is–who
is not fit to be any man's wife."  He seized
her both hands now and pressed them respectfully
and penitentially.

Britton took his wife's arm with an air of
jealous ownership while she gazed up at him, a
tremulous expression of wonder in her eyes as if
the action were new to her and unexplainable.

"No," said Rex, somewhat passionately, "this
isn't the other woman whom you know, Ainsworth.
Mercia is the soul which the other never had!"

   CHAPTER XVII.

.. vspace:: 2

Lady Rossland's reception for the New
Shoreham candidate on the evening preceding the
nomination day was a thing of note.

For the space of ten hours, Britton had been
out among his constituents with Lord Rossland,
Ainsworth, and Trascott, who had come down
from his London work to witness the honors
bestowed upon his friend.  At seven o'clock, Rex
returned alone to Britton Hall, the curate and
the lawyer having gone on with Rossland to his
country-seat, where the function was to be held.

The strain of canvassing had been more
wearisome than a day of Yukon mushing, but dinner
and a bath refreshed him.  Upstairs, he called
his wife's maid.

"At what time has your mistress ordered the
carriage?" he asked.

"Nine o'clock, sir,–if that will suit you."  The
maid spoke almost timidly, as if she
recognized some gulf between husband and wife, and
feared that their plans for the evening might
conflict.

"That will do very well," Britton decided.
"Tell her I will await her at nine."

He crossed to his own suite and entered the
bedroom, where Bassing, his man, had laid out
his clothes.  He knew the room of old, and a glow
of possession thrilled him.  The magnificence of
its appointing was a delight.  The heavy
furniture, the lofty fretted ceiling, the ponderous
chandelier, and thick Oriental curtains, unaltered
in setting for three generations, gave an impression
of stability which had a far-reaching effect.
His grandfather had slept, as he himself slept, in
the high canopied bed with its massive carved
corner posts, and ancestral pride buoyed up
Britton to the heights of egotism.

He dressed slowly and carefully, with a due
consciousness of the relation between appearance
and personality, and descended the stairs at five
minutes to nine.  The carriage had not yet drawn
up in the driveway, nor had Mercia come from
her apartments.  By the door stood Crandell, the
footman who had served his uncle, and who regarded
the advent of the young master with satisfaction.

For five minutes Rex waited, and the carriage
wheels shrieked on the gravel as the driver
wheeled his horses sharply in front of the great
arched entrance.  A silver-chimed clock pealed
nine in the drawing-room, and the soft rustle of
Mercia's garments sounded on the stairway.

Britton looked up involuntarily, his face flushing
slightly.  His wife's beauty was a revelation
to which no man could deny homage; she carried
herself with distinction enhanced by a peculiar,
free rhythm of movement which is a heritage of
the life in the open.  Her individuality seemed a
blending of youthful bloom with a certain
mature, womanly power born of the true
conception of existence.

And marring her sweet winsomeness, was a
scarcely observable flaw, a cold reserve
maintained, apparently, not of inward intention but
by the outward pressure of circumstance.  This
unbidden attribute matched Britton's unemotional,
respectful attitude, presenting, as it were,
foil to foil in the guarding of a common neutrality.

"Let me hold your cloak," he said deferentially.

She suffered his help with a distant, though
polite, acknowledgment, and Crandell opened
the door.  The horses pranced impatiently upon
the white sand before the portico, and Mercia
hurried out.  Her husband followed quickly,
handed her in, and they dashed away.

The drive to Rossland House was made
practically in silence.  Britton spoke once,
remarking on the hot night and predicting rain.

Outside Lord Rossland's grand country-seat
their equipage fell in line, stopped at the steps,
and let them down.  They found themselves
traversing the length of the front hall, which
opened on the splendid reception-rooms.

It was nearly twelve months since Britton had
mingled with society of this class, that is, of his
own county, and he experienced the feeling of an
actor who plays an unfamiliar part.  The
sensation stamped his bearing and augmented that
chill reserve which had never been present
before he left England.  He attempted to shake
it off in the exchange of greetings with Lord
and Lady Rossland and others.  In this he
succeeded to a certain degree, and when he had made
the round of presentation as the coming member,
the contact with his fellows wore away the shyness.

He was separated from his wife, and, flattered
by Rossland's patronage and amused by Ainsworth's
ironic comment on everything they saw,
Britton's affability grew more marked.

Toward the supper-hour he found Mercia again
in the rooms, in company with Lady Rossland.

"Here is the truant," cried her ladyship,
laughing.  "We searched everywhere for you, sir."

"No truant, my dear," put in Lord Rossland.
"I have been heaping his responsibilities upon him."

"But here is a responsibility he has forgotten–his
wife," objected Lady Rossland, in feigned
reproach.  "Reginald, take her in to supper.
A score of men have begged the honor, but I have
been obdurate for your sake!"

Britton bowed ostentatiously, catching her
ladyship's bantering spirit, yet a shade of that
cloudy reserve dampened his manner as he took
his wife's arm.  They passed on to the supper-rooms,
with the Rosslands leading and his lordship's
sister behind with Kinmair, editor and
owner of *The Daily Challenge*, one of the most
powerful organs in London.  Kinmair, next to
Lord Rossland, was Britton's staunchest supporter.

They made a merry group at the profusely
decorated tables, and because the evening grew
so warm in spite of wide open doors and
swinging casements, the quarter-hour's refreshment
proved grateful.

"Now," announced her ladyship, when they
emerged from the roses and palms, "you are
thrown upon your own resources.  There are
the galleries, the gardens, billiards, and cigars!
You may play bridge up-stairs, dance in the
drawing-rooms, row upon the river, or interview
the spirit reader in the conservatory."

Britton raised his eyebrows.

"Ah!" he smiled, "–a new departure?"

"It is all the rage in London now," explained
Lord Rossland's sister, Dora.  "Everyone has a
theosophist at their evening functions to give a
séance or read futures."

Rex laughed a little, thinking of the great,
tight-locked Yukon where the issues of life and
death prohibited any such toys or trifling.

"I–I am afraid I am somewhat behind the
times," he ventured, looking at Mercia for a brief
instant.

"Then you shall be initiated into the mysteries
at once," cried Lady Rossland, "and I must
conduct you to Madame Spiritualist.  A politician
should know his future.  Should he not, Mrs. Britton?"

"If I were a politician, I should hardly dare to
gaze on it," Mercia smiled.  "Disappointment
might be lying somewhere in wait."

"Men have no such fears," Lord Rossland
blustered in his kindly way.  "If they had, they
would never reach the top, and Britton has, I
believe, a brilliant career waiting for him.  But,
my dear, if you are going to act as his guide,
I shall take Mrs. Britton through the galleries.
She wished to see the paintings."

"Thank you, yes," said Mercia.  "I have heard
of your famous pictures, and I adore the art."

"She has the great gift, Rossland," observed
Rex, turning aside with her ladyship, "and she
may tell you things even about your own canvases."

Kinmair and Lord Rossland's sister went into
the garden among the fountains, while Lady
Rossland took her recruit to the conservatory.  On the
way they passed the billiard-rooms and saw
Ainsworth engaged in his customary game with
the redoubtable Trascott.  Her ladyship smiled
at their earnest devotion to the stroke.

"Your friends are fine men," she remarked
appreciatively.  "I doubt if there are in England
two grander representatives of their respective
professions."

"I believe you," agreed Britton, with a sudden
gravity approaching severity, "but here we are."

They had reached the conservatory, and Lady
Rossland's nephew came out with a slip of paper
in his hand.  Her ladyship bad commissioned
him to act as the theosophist's assistant and play
the part of scout.  He was a slim, light-haired
youth, and his aunt had insisted at his
christening that he should be named Guy.

"Hello," said Guy, "your palmist has given
me a list of guests for whom she wants to gaze.
Here it is!  You're first on the paper, Britton.
See?  Now go along and get through while I
bring your successor."

He pushed Rex inside and closed the door,
taking his aunt away with him.

"Now was that name on the list coincidence
or design?" Britton asked himself before he
came to the end of the conservatory's corridor.

One corner of the cool place had been curtained
off with blue silk hangings as a retreat for the
spiritualist.  Her tiny tent was closed and lighted
from within by a red-globed lamp which gave a
subdued effect.  The pavilion was arranged thus
to give the palmist the advantage of illumination
while her subject stood outside in partial darkness.

Rex felt awkward and ill at ease at the weighty
sense of desolation which filled the long, empty
conservatory.  His footsteps paused uncertainly,
but the waiting priestess heard them.

"Come closer please," she said in a muffled
tone that sounded disguised.

Britton obeyed the summons with an increasing
sensation of awkwardness for which he was
at a loss to account.  He stood so near the soft
curtains that they brushed his body without
weight, like fine cobwebs, and he could perceive a
small horizontal slit in the pavilion's side which
was not noticeable before.  Set back of it, so as
to block the vision and prevent an inspection of
the interior, was a Japanese screen in weird colors.

His mind was filled with an irritation aroused
by the feminine whim that had sent him to this
place.  The whole environment jarred on him
as possessing an illusion disproportionate to his
mental vision.

"Well?" he demanded in a voice which set
the responsibility for his coming on the head of
the person within the gaudy pavilion.

There was a noise inside that seemed like a
smothered exclamation of surprise together with
a vague rustle of woman's garments, and the
same muffled tone as before became audible,
though it seemed shaken and difficult to control.

"Extend your palms through the opening,"
was the subdued order of the spirit reader.

Rex hesitated.  The incongruity of this
dallying imbued a sort of rankling disgust for its
exponent and an ashamed opinion of himself.

"You are a doubter?" the unseen spiritualist
asked.  Her inflection was one of sarcasm.

Britton laughed scornfully.  "It is hardly
worth while," he replied.

"But still you belong to the sceptic class," the
voice insisted.  "Please extend your hands.  I
promise you that you will be surprised at my
methods."

Rex stirred his feet, the motion making an
inordinately loud noise in the deserted place.  He
listened when the echoes ceased, but young Guy
Rossland had not returned.  He was doubtless
having some trouble in finding Britten's successor.

"I promise to surprise you," repeated the
palmist.

"Surprise!–yes," Rex assented.  "Convincing
is a different matter.  You know I have not
followed the fad."

"Nevertheless, I think conviction is hard upon
you," came the declaration from the tent.  "Will
you give me a trial?"  There was a defiant note
in the question.

"That is but fair, now you speak of it," said
Britton, mockingly.  He thrust his arms through
the slit with a total lack of ceremony.

A pair of soft, electric palms took his, and the
current of the hidden woman's presence flowed
through every vein in his body.

Rex stood immovable as if a secret shock had
fixed his feet.  He cried out with an inarticulate
exclamation because he knew the touch, but his
paralyzed vocal organs would frame no speech.
A short, dramatic silence succeeded his outcry.
The drone of a clumsy, waking fly beat distinctly
on the panes; the creak of oar-locks on the river
rose insistently through the open conservatory
windows; beneath the sills the gentle plashing
of the fountain water changed to a gurgle of
wicked glee.

In the silence, Britton was beginning to find
his self-possession, when the sorceress spoke, her
voice now undisguised.

"It's centuries and ages since we were so close,
Rex," she said–and the magnetic hands were
glued to his in a melting, appealing touch.
"Isn't it ages and ages?" she continued passionately.

Britten's answer was a cry like that of a
trapped bear.  He wrenched his hands loose, swept
away the intervening curtains, as he once swept
the silken portières from an old-time boudoir,
and stood face to face with the siren it had held.
She had taken off her veiled turban, and her
eyes shone like stars, with a former potent lure.

   CHAPTER XVIII.

.. vspace:: 2

Everything whizzed about Britton for a few
seconds.  In the red glow of light from the
demolished pavilion, the floor throbbed and rocked
like the deck of a yacht, and the glass walls of the
conservatory tilted up sharply.  Rex put a hand
on the wire which had held the curtains and
steadied himself.

"So it was design," he said harshly, accusingly.

One glance at his face told Maud Morris that
honeyed words could not subjugate him.  Appeal
was rendered useless for her purpose; there
remained compulsion.  She stepped back a little
at his grim anger till she leaned against some
flowering vine in the corner window-box.
Between them stood a small table on which rested
the adjuncts of her pretended art.

"Yes," she corroborated, with a flicker of
satire, "it was design.  You know, Rex, that I
have no faith whatever in coincidence.  You
believed me to be thousands of miles away in
Dawson City?"

"Why have you dogged me?" demanded Britton,
bluntly.  "To impersonate Mrs. Grundy as
you did last winter in that same place?"

"Was it so illy done?" she questioned in turn,
with a cruel intonation.  Her fingers broke a
bloom from the vine, and she caressed it with
her lips.

"It was art–fine art," Rex bitterly declared,
"and it accomplished the intended purpose of
involving me in an intricacy of despair.  Your
appearance here hints at a repetition of that
trouble.  Is that your object?  Have you trailed
me in order to work fresh mischief?"  He spoke
with the air of a man driven to bay, one whose
impulse is to face and have done with a difficulty
once for all.

"The question of mischief-making rests with
yourself," Maud Morris temporized.  "I admit
that I followed you, faked connections with the
Mahatma Institute in order to be present to-night––"

"Why to-night?" Britton interrupted, regarding
the soulless thing searchingly.

"I wished to see you before tomorrow," the
woman answered, "before you accept that
nomination."  She turned away a little to the open
window and looked indifferently out upon the
long, shadowed gardens, as if placing no weight
upon her observation.

The action vindicated a former power of
command, and a momentary triumph was obtained.
Rex dropped his uplifted hand from the wire
so swiftly that the tautened metal sang in a
high-pitched crescendo, and he took two quick
steps to her side.

"You are deeper than any Mahatma witch,"
he said tersely, "and there is something behind
your words.  Why did you wish to see me before
the Convention tomorrow?"

There was a short pause while she picked
reflectively at the sleeve of the loose Oriental
gown which enveloped her supple body.  Then
she faced Britton squarely, her blue-green eyes
glowing into his.

"Because you will never accept that nomination,"
she answered dramatically.

The unexpected shot told.  Rex started, but
the necessity of the moment recalled his sang-froid,
and he showed no sign of inward perturbation.

"I surprise you?"  She was feeling for the
effect with both voice and eye.

"Surprise?" Rex parleyed.  "Why should I
be surprised at anything you do or say?  My
experience with and observation of you has been
infinitely varied and valuably instructive.  No,
I am not at all astonished, only mystified.  You
will, of course, explain!"

She bit her lip in obvious displeasure at her
failure to move him and at his cool criticism
of her fickle, spiteful disposition, which had been
revealed all too fully in times that were dead
to Britton.  She made a slight, almost imperceptible
motion that brought her nearer to him.

"You will, of course, explain," Rex repeated,
coldly attentive.

"Willingly!" she abruptly exclaimed.  "The
man who came alone out of Five Mountain Gulch
can never represent New Shoreham when New
Shoreham knows the facts connected with that
great Five Mountain strike!"  She met Britton's
intense gaze with a level glance full of a subtle
confidence and waited for his utter confusion,
the anticipated result of her significant explanation.

But the anticipated result was not realized
in that way!  The perturbing effect she expected
did not follow her pointed words.  That they had
any influence on Britton was shown only by the
stiffening of his shoulders and the squaring of
his stern jaw.  The absence of fear, the presence
of which had been exultingly foreseen by Maud
Morris, tended to vaguely disconcert her.

"Your impression does not coincide with
mine?" she asked at last, indecision being
noticeable in her tone.

Britton reached out both arms, resting his
palms heavily on the window-sill, and looked at
her with head turned sidewise.  His profile in
the subdued red light was grim and powerful as
granite sculpturing.

"Suppose," he began brusquely, "that New
Shoreham knows.  What is left for the man?"

Maud Morris smiled.  "Your intuition is
almost womanly," she said with returning
assurance.  "For the man?  I should surely suggest
some far-away, far-away part where no one knows
or cares.  There the man would easily find
respite, especially if he had the companionship
of, say, a very old friend, a–a friend whom
perhaps he once regarded highly."  Her meaning
was flagrantly vivid.  The night breeze stirred
her garments, wafting a faint, enervating
perfume to Britten's nostrils.  The fountain water
plashed timidly now, and the spectral shadows
crouched on the clipped lawns.  Over the thick
woodland copse the angry lightning clawed the
black horizon into a million red-edged fragments.
Rex found himself in a position singularly
difficult and unpleasant.  It bordered even on the
dangerous.  Mingled irresolution and
indignation handicapped him in a measure, but he
decided to persevere in sounding this woman's
intentions to the very bottom.

"Granted that the oblivion you speak of and
the escape from consequence could be so found,"
Britton said, "there is a thing which you persist
in overlooking, the possibility of the man having
a wife."

A warning note of wrath accompanied Britton's
last word.  Any keen ear might have recognized
it, but Maud Morris was so engrossed with the
working out of the systematic project upon which
she had embarked that she missed the voiced
danger signal.

"I do not overlook that," she remarked with
an inconsequent shrug.  "I ignore it!"

All Britton's suppressed anger broke bounds
and flamed to the surface.  He whirled suddenly
and struck his clenched right hand in the open
palm of his left.

"Look here," he cried, coming to the point
with a graphic directness which was a most
creditable trait of his character, "I think I have
grasped your meaning and your proposition.
I must refuse this nomination, desert my wife,
and disappear in a foreign country or you will
tell what you know of Five Mountain Gulch.  Am
I right?"

"On the whole, yes," she replied, maintaining
her brazen serenity in the face of his wrath.
"I swore I would separate you from that little
saint, and, before heaven, I will!"

"Why did you not act before, in Dawson?"

"I learned what I know at Samson Creek
when Morris died," she said impetuously.  "You
had started for England when I got back to
Dawson.  I came on your heels, and I am to have
my revenge."

"So your informant was Morris," Rex commented
with a certain relief.  "Do you expect to
intimidate me by the use of a dying man's
delirium, by means of some irrational tale?  Let me
tell you, Maud Morris, that I have walked too
close to real danger to be frightened by a phantom!"

"Morris knew everything," she cried vehemently.
"He followed you all the way up the
Klondike to Five Mountain Gulch and saw you
shoot Lessari."

Britton reeled, self-control shocked out of him.

"Morris did?" he stammered–"but it was
self-defence–"

"Was it?" she interrupted, leering into his
face with supercilious smiles.  "Would the
public believe it?  Have you an atom of proof?  You
may say that the lack of proof, of substantiation,
works both ways.  That may be, but proof is not
necessary for my purpose.  The simple statement,
the all-pervading rumor, the unpreventable
scandal, will do far better.  Do you see where
you are now, Rex,–the old, proud Rex?  Do you
know where you are?  Yes, you do–in my
hand!"  She slowly closed her outstretched fingers.

Egotistical triumph gleamed in her every lineament.
Britton, wrestling with his deep problem,
did not mark her expression, for he had made a
vital discovery which filled him with mental disgust.

"I know now the mysteries of the poisoned
dogs and the sled plunging into the abyss," he
announced in a horrified way, "and I can tell you
where your husband is at this moment.  Morris
is in hell, suffering torment for a double murder!
Twice in that frozen wilderness he apparently
compassed our destruction with the most diabolical
intent.  He is as guilty as if Lessari and
myself had both died at his hand."

Britton's awful earnestness embarrassed her,
but she made a pretence of laughing sceptically.
Distant thunder echoed with her laugh in low
growlings and mutterings, and the far-off rising
downs were nakedly etched by vivid, incessant
streaks of lightning as if the mountain spirits
were working themselves up to a climax of
passion that must culminate in a ruthless and
pathetic tragedy.

The strains of the orchestra in the drawing-rooms
were drowned by the threatenings of the
storm, and Rex could hear people hurrying in
from the gardens and lawns and from the river
to reach cover and escape the expected deluge.
An unconscious wonderment as to whether young
Guy Rossland had lost himself in searching for
the next man whose name was on the theosophist's
list passed through Britton's mind.  The
false theosophist herself interrupted his pondering.

"If Morris is guilty through intent," she said,
"what of your own deed?"  The shallow mockery
of her glance belied the sense of judicious
importance she tried to attach to her utterance.
Rex commenced to see at last that the woman was
but playing for a stake and holding all the trumps.

"I feel no guilt, nothing but remorse," he
replied, "for I stand clear of any deliberate act."

"But you cannot prove it," she cautioned.
"Picture public condemnation and horror when
they know!"

"Go and tell them," Rex fiercely returned,
accepting with his accustomed thrill the combat
which could not be averted.

"Ah!" she exclaimed.  "Then with such
permission I shall tell your wife first."

Britton winced visibly, and his face was bereft
of its ruddy color.  He caught the woman's
wrists with the motion of crushing a venomous
thing.

"Good God, you vampire!" he cried.

She had used some weapon known only to
themselves, and, judging by its effect on the
two standing thus, the weapon was one of
incalculable cruelty.

The conservatory door flew open with a rattle
of shattered glass, admitting Lady Rossland and
Mercia fleeing from the gardens amid the
spattering raindrops.

"Oh!" they exclaimed simultaneously, on
catching sight of the tableau where the silken
tent had stood.  "Oh!"  Mercia's voice was low
and hurt.  Lady Rossland's rose up, pitched
higher in an outraged tone.

Britton dropped the wrists he had grasped and
turned toward the two women, humiliation
written on his grave face, but the pride of Mercia
would not allow her to wait for a forthcoming
apology.

"I fancy we intrude," she said coldly.  "Come,
Lady Rossland, we can probably reach the
house."  Her ladyship wheeled across the
doorstep, flashing back scornful eyes, and took
Mercia's arm as they hurried out.

Rex gave an eager, pleading cry and darted
forward.

"Wait," he cried entreatingly.  "You are misjudging–"

But they were gone in the darkness, having
raced up the gravel walk to the great
illuminated house!  The big, round drops wetted
Britton's cheeks and dashed on his head.  A
moment he stood on the flags at the door,
yearning to follow and explain, but a more vital and
immediate necessity lay behind him in the conservatory.

He turned back, keeping himself forcibly in
hand, determined on a summary and decisive
dealing with the pregnant issue thrust upon him
by Maud Morris.

"That," he said to her, "was the most humiliating
thing any wife could see, yet it meant
nothing at all!"

A change had come over her since the sudden
apparition of the two women in the doorway.
The fear of failure, inspired by the sweet, pure
beauty of Mercia, seemed to hold her in its grip,
and she called to her aid the old resource of
alluring appeal.

"Don't say that, Rex," she pleaded, with a
touch of pathos.  "Have you altogether
forgotten the old days?  There must be memories
sometimes!"

"No," said Britton, doggedly, "I could not
remember them if I would."

"You are very trying," she murmured,
petulant as a crossed child.  "Can you not listen to
reason?"

"There is only one way of reasoning soundly
and in accordance with universal law," Rex
answered with conviction.  "That reasoning is
along the line of right.  I am prepared to follow
it to the bitter end."

She looked up in amazement during a short
interval.

"Do you realize all that your words imply?"
she questioned incredulously.  "I cannot think
you do!"

"Yes, everything they imply," he answered,
filled with the weary languor attendant upon
nervous strain.

She was not left to surmise.  Britton's meaning
was plain.  Her confidence began to shake.

"The alternative!" she began plaintively,
"–surely you have understood me!"

"Too well," laughed Britton, harshly, "and
I would rather go to prison–which I shall
certainly not do, since, as you say, there is no
proof!"

The woman's cheeks and brow went crimson
with annoyance coupled with shame; she felt
the demoralizing force of man's scorn.

"Rather than take that alternative, you will
suffer me to tell Mercia?" she asked uncertainly.

"No," Rex answered in a ringing voice, "for
I am going to tell her!"

She gasped.  "You!" she exclaimed precipitately.
"It is suicide!  Are you entirely mad?"

There was in the woman's manner the
recognition of an impending catastrophe, the
knowledge of immeasurable possibilities.  Britton
instinctively felt her disappointment, and it helped
to bring back to him, in a fair degree, his original
assurance, confidence, and reliance.

"It will be the sanest thing I ever did," he
declared.

Then the mask of the woman's plotting and
machination fell, and she stood revealed in her
uncertain status of life, fighting for what she
loved in her own contemptible way.

"Rex, Rex," she cried incoherently, "I can't
let you do that.  My God, you know what it
would mean!"

She grasped his hands in her intolerable fear,
but he rescued them with a calm gesture.  The
action saved them from a second surprise.

The greenhouse door burst open more violently
than before, and Guy Rossland stamped up and
down in a pair of rain-soaked pumps, sending the
wet flying in all directions.

"Ruined," he said woefully, regarding his
pulpy patent leathers.  "By Jove, but it's a
beastly night.  Hello! tent blown down?"

"A gust through that open window," explained
the theosophist, who had resumed her veil.
"Please close it and help me with the curtain.
I am afraid the rain has frightened all my subjects."

"Couldn't find Kinmair," lamented Guy,
climbing on the sill to fasten the casement.  "The
bally idiot!  He's next after Britton.  Hunted
him through all the gardens, and then they told
me he'd gone punting.  Went on the river and
got caught–worse luck!  Jove, my feet feel as
if I were barefoot in the marsh."

"Kinmair can postpone his visit," Rex said.
"Indeed, the storm will cause a general
postponement.  No one can come through this rain.
I think I'll make a run for it!"

But he walked, seeming not to notice the
violence and the downpour.  The coolness was
pleasing on his face, and the damp lowered the
feverish temperature of his heated blood, though
it proved disastrous to his immaculate dress
clothes.

He could see neither Mercia nor Lady
Rossland when he entered, but he encountered
Trascott elaborating on philanthropies to a penniless
dowager.  The curate did not note Britton's
personal appearance, so deep was he in a cherished
plan of building orphan homes and reading
rooms for the poor of London, a plan involving
the expenditure of something like two millions of
money.

"It's admirable," murmured the dowager, who
herself had to scrape to keep up appearances.
"It's a most beautiful scheme, Mr. Trascott.
You have every technicality well within your
grasp.  What is to prevent the carrying out of
those details?"

"The money," Britton heard Trascott answer
sadly.  "It exists as yet only in my dreams.  I
have advanced my theories and worked for their
realization, but the unthinking rich have not
responded.  Sometimes I feel as if I shall never
live long enough to see my project undertaken
either by my own hand or by that of a more
competent man."

"Still, it is ideal," the dowager returned, as
Rex moved on past them.  "And it is something
to cherish an ideal to the end of one's life, even if
one never enjoys its realization."

Britton took the thought as applied to his own
existence, especially in its present crisis, and
turned it over and over in his mind while he
searched the different rooms for Ainsworth.

Within Rossland's great country mansion the
gaiety of the occasion was undiminished.  The
games, the talk, the dancing, all went on as
merrily as if no tempest raged outside.  The
decorated chambers were illuminated with such a
blaze of light that the flashes of the sky's electric
current were scarcely in evidence through drawn
blinds.  Only the spaced, resounding roll of
thunder and the crash of giant trees in the
woodland groves told that a terrific storm was in
progress.

In the centre of the music salon he saw the
Rosslands with a crowd of guests, lamenting the
disagreeable night that had driven them from the
river.  Mercia was not with them, and Rex felt
that after the incident of the conservatory he
must avoid Lady Rossland for the moment.

He crossed the hall and ran into young Guy,
who, looking very flushed and disturbed,
appeared to have emerged from some more or less
inglorious conflict.  Guy had on dry shoes, but
they had not sufficed to smooth his apparently
ruffled feelings.

"What's wrong?" asked Britton, remembering
the youth's capacity for getting into trouble.
"Been quarreling with someone in the house?"

"Quarreling?  Not much–worse luck!" the
boy blurted out ingenuously.  "But, by Jove,
aunt has the beastliest temper in Sussex!  She's
down on the theosophist she hired about
something or other.  Packed her off in the rain!"

"What?" Rex asked, interestedly.  "Lady
Rossland packed off the hired Mahatma woman?"

"Just that," Guy answered.  "In a cab with
James, through all the beastly rain–to the
Crystal Hotel.  That's the best in New Shoreham,
and aunt told James to pay the bill."

Rex was thinking retrospectively.  If his own
concerns had not compelled the deepest gravity,
he would have been inclined to laugh.  As it was,
he gave Guy a speculative look.

"Beastly temper aunt has," the youth
continued.  "Jove, didn't she rate me!  Gave me
fits for not holding down my position–guess it
must have been on account of the tent.  How'd
I know the stuffy thing would blow?  And
Kinmair, the bally idiot, on the river with
Dora! drat him!"

The nephew rattled on with the frank tongue
of youth, and a smile grew by degrees around
Britton's mouth and eyes.  It was like the smile
of a soldier in the firing line when he gets an
unexpected respite and forgets for a brief
moment the lurking danger and the strain.

"I wouldn't take it to heart," Rex said while
the smile lasted.  "It wasn't your fault, Guy,
and, now I come to think of it, perhaps–I–I
should have closed that conservatory window."

In the smoking-room Britton found Ainsworth
whom he had been seeking.

"Stay with the pole instead of the punt?"
asked Ainsworth, lightly, surveying his friend's
wet clothes.

"Never in my life," replied Britton, very
seriously.

"Jump into the river or one of the fountains
to rescue somebody?" the lawyer continued in the
same bantering way, but Rex had not the heart
to match his flippancy.

"Can you get Trascott away and follow us
home?" he asked instead, speaking what was on
his mind.  "I would like you both to give me an
hour after we reach the Hall.  I want to get
some advice and some opinions."

Ainsworth looked at him with awakened interest.

"Something on the political side, eh?" he
questioned smilingly.

"Yes, partly," Rex responded.  "This convention
affair is involved."

"Ah!" laughed Ainsworth, "I recognize in you
the true politician's trait, namely the utter
inability to draw a hard and fast line between
business and pleasure.  But go on with your
wife!  Trascott and I will not be far behind if
Rossland will send us in one of his carriages, and
of course he will.  I am indefatigable in your
interests, my dear fellow, and we can talk for
three hours if you like."

The lawyer went out to break Trascott's
conversation with the stout dowager.  Britton
remained in the smoking-room a moment,
writing two short letters, one to Lord Rossland and
one to Kinmair.  It seemed a very odd proceeding
when he was inside one man's house and
within reach of the other man, but it was in
keeping with Britton's secret resolve.

Crossing the drawing-room in search of Mercia,
he met her alone.  She greeted him with the
same cold, reserved smile that she habitually
gave him.  Her beauty forced its way to his
heart and left an aching pang.

"Your view of that incident to-night was
entirely wrong," he said gravely.  "In an hour or
two you will have the right of it.  This is hardly
the place for explanations."

She inclined her head with a regal air which
became her well, but which few women could
assume because they had not the royal cast of
loveliness to support it.

"Explanations are quite unnecessary," she
quietly returned.  "I do not ask for any."

"Yet I proffer them–at the right time,"
Britton said.  "Please do not misunderstand
me."  There was courteous pleading in his voice, and it
did not escape Mercia.

When they bade Lady Rossland good-night,
with their own carriage and that supplied the
other men standing in wait, Britton spoke to the
hostess of the same thing.

"Lady Rossland," he said, "there is an
explanation due you.  My wife will ease your mind
when I have explained to her.  You will have no
cause for resentment."

"I am glad of that," her ladyship observed
with a bright smile, pressing his hand more
warmly.  "Indeed, I am very pleased to hear it.
I was sure there must be some mistake."

Britton gave her the two letters.  "Another
favor!" he begged.  "Kindly hand these to Lord
Rossland and Kinmair in the morning.  My
request is a little strange, but I would like to
have these delivered as I say."

"Certainly," laughed her ladyship.  "You do
not amaze me.  You politicians are always
involved in some intricate or uncommon scheme.
These shall be handed to my husband and to
Kinmair in the morning as you have requested.
Good-night to you all.  Take good care of your
wife, sir!"

The rain thrummed on the canopy covering the
walk like a hundred small drums beating tattoos
as they hastened to the carriages.

Britton's stood first, the horses frantic with the
roar of the sky's heavy artillery.  Rex took
advantage of a lull in their plunging and handed
Mercia in.

They dashed away into the oppressive darkness,
thick as a North Sea fog, seeing but little
beyond the pale circle cast by their carriage
lamps.  Intermittent wicked blue flashes
revealed the surrounding country at intervals of
a second's duration, and a fleeting, dreary
panorama was unrolled.  These momentary glimpses
showed the winding black road running in murky
rivulets; they uncovered copses and groves with
foliage bedraggled and rent, with branches torn
from the trunks, so that their white scars
flickered ghost-like beneath the lightning's glare;
they photographed a flooded stretch of down
lashed by the descending cloud-torrents and
vanishing mysteriously into the ungauged distance.

Mercia leaned back upon the carriage cushions
without speaking.  Her diamonds quivered when
the lightning came, and Britton could mark her
wonderful profile.

A startling sense of the unreality of his
married life lay upon him; the impassableness of the
secret gulf separating him from his wife was
most poignantly impressed.

"Mercia," he began, "I–I wonder–" and
paused hesitatingly.

"What?" she asked, gravely meeting his eyes
in a spasmodic flash of electricity.

"I wonder if you remember that evening we
came over the trail by Indian River," Britton
continued, "the night you saved my life!"

"Yes, I remember," she answered, studiously
calm.  "That was the beginning."  Her voice
showed that she did not wish to continue in that
train of thought.  Rex sighed and pressed as
close to his side of the vehicle as he could till
they swept through the curved drive of Britton
Hall.

Rossland's borrowed carriage bowled up
behind, bearing the lawyer and the curate.

Ainsworth bounced upon the lighted porch
beside the husband and wife.

"Awful night!" he shivered.  "Must be a
pack of fiends abroad!  Say–what was in those
letters, Britton?  Anything new turned up?"

"Yes," Rex answered, "they contained my
refusal of the candidature."

"The devil!" said Ainsworth.

   CHAPTER XX.

.. vspace:: 2

The gun-room adjoined the library in Britton
Hall.  Ainsworth and Trascott sat in the former
chamber, awaiting the advent of their host.

The red-eyed butler, who had been sleeping in
a chair, appeared with a tray containing cognac
and cigars to drive away the chill of the dismally
wet night, but the lawyer was in such a state of
anger and suspense that he wished neither brandy
nor the weed.

"Put them down," he snapped.  "Where's
your master now?"

"Upstairs, sir, if you please," the butler
stammered, confused by Ainsworth's penetrating eyes.
"I presume, sir, he's changing his things–getting
on dry, so to speak!  He ordered me to
bring you these."

Ainsworth stabbed a finger in the direction of
a shell table strewn with paper cases and long
brass cartridges.

"Leave them there," the irritated lawyer
directed, "and get out!"  The abashed butler
obeyed.

"D–n him!" Ainsworth fumed, anathematizing
the master when the servant was out of hearing.
"The infernal nerve of him to refuse that
candidature!  And to refuse it in that way!
Good Lord!"  He gave vent to his feelings by
stamping about the gun-room, while Trascott
pondered in silence, filled with a vague mistrust
that some drastic coercion was responsible for
Britton's action.

The furnishings of the gun-room were the usual
cabinets and appliances for the chase and
kindred sports.  One wall, however, was hung with
objects not commonly seen in an English country-seat.
These were two complete Klondike outfits,
a woman's and a man's.

In making the round of the chamber, Ainsworth
came to them.  He stopped and scrutinized
the peculiar accoutrements attentively.

There were guns, rifles, revolvers, and
sheath-knives strung up, all showing the scar and stain
of hard service.  Woolen Arctic garments, oilskins,
gauntlets, and parkas, with two buckskin skirts
and sweaters, hung in rows from the pegs.  A
duffle of moccasins, leggings, pack-straps,
tump-lines, dunnage-bags and dog-whips filled a large,
deep shelf, while two pairs of snowshoes, taller
than a man, stood in the corner.

The lawyer examined each article in turn and
suddenly faced round to Trascott.

"Can the Klondike have cracked his brain?"
he asked seriously.  "They say it drives scores
of strong men mad!"

The curate shook his head as his glance also
travelled to the equipments of the trails.

"Britton's as sane as yourself," was his
answer, "but I know he is in dire anxiety.  His
face showed that when we came in."

Steps sounded in the library, seeming like
unnecessarily loud ones calculated to give warning
or to hide some other noise.  The curtains,
screening the doorway of the two rooms, parted very
slightly, and Britton entered, throwing the
hangings in place behind him.

"Ah!" grunted Ainsworth, "here you are with
your insolence–"

"Don't!" interrupted Britton, putting out a
hand.  "Don't talk in that strain.  Let me tell
you a story which will explain this attitude of
mine and a good many other things besides."  He
sat down at the cartridge table and placed
his elbows on it.  An expression of bitterness
and renunciation rested on his face.

"Go on," said the lawyer, backing against the
wall, "and speak loudly.  This thunder is deafening."

A long, fierce detonation rolled and crashed
in justification of his words before he had finished
speaking them.

"Though I made the famous strike at Five
Mountain Gulch, a strike that is now history,"
Britton began in the queer silence which ensued,
"I had months of a hard-luck siege in the Yukon
before making my pile.  In fact, when I went out
of Dawson on the Samson Creek stampede, I was
at the limit of my means.  My last dollar was
invested in my dog-team, outfit, and supplies.

"Well, the south branch of the creek, according
to rumor, showed the richest, and I made a
break for it.  Ill luck seemed determined on
dogging me, for I found South Samson staked from
one end to the other.  You have no idea of the
complete disheartenment such a thing gives!"  He
paused a second, reflecting on that by-gone
disappointment.

"Yes, yes," assented the lawyer, somewhat
impatiently; "stream all staked and not a cent
with which to buy anyone out!  Go on."

"I had received a hint at Tagish Post from
Franco Lessari, a Corsican and a former
Government courier, whom I had pulled out of Lake
Bennett, that there was gold on North Samson,
so I crossed to the other branch.  The overflow
of the stampede filed in on it, too, but lots of
ground could be had.  On North Samson I
burned holes in the gravel and prospected in the
freezing weather for some days without result.
It happened that Lessari came along with the
rest to this fork of the creek one night.  He
wanted to show me a place where a trapper had
told him he had found good gold-signs, so I took
him into my camp, and we moved to the locality
in the morning.  His outfit was very meagre; he
had no tent and a minimum of poor food; my
offer was a blessing to him, but I wanted to give
him something in exchange for the information,
even if it proved valueless."

Britton paused a second time, as if seeking to
condense the massed details ahead of him.
Ainsworth turned his face towards the curtained
doorway.

"I feel a draft," he complained, "and that
tapestry is swaying.  Is there a window open?"  He
made a movement to investigate, but Britton
stopped him with a gesture, observing:

"It's probably Gubbins, the butler, seeing if
the outer buildings are safe.  He's very nervous
about lightning.  Be patient, Ainsworth!  I am
coming to the end.  The North Samson project
didn't pan out, but we hung on there till a
drunken Thron-Diuck Indian came into the camp
one night.  He was one of a tribe who had
discovered the Five Mountain deposit, and he sold
us the information, together with an eight-ounce
alluvial sample which proved the truth of his
assertions, for my solitary flask of whiskey.

"That bottle of firewater brought me two
million dollars!  It was, you say, a good bargain.
But you are wrong.  It was the worst barter I
ever made.  I wish to God I had never seen that
Indian!"  Britton's voice sounded with a
passionate, piteous vehemence.

"Why?" cried Trascott, in wonder and
sympathy.  "Why?"

"Lessari and I went up the Klondike River,"
continued Britton, without answering the curate,
"toward the region of the five hills as I had
mapped out the way.  Never mind the details or
the hardships, but listen to some points which are
essential parts of what I am trying to tell.
When we passed through the Klondike Cañon, we
heard a dog-train coming after us, but it never
appeared to our sight.  Lessari fainted from
fatigue and exposure within six miles of our
destination.  I made camp and nursed him that
night.  In the morning our dogs were poisoned."

"Poisoned?" echoed Ainsworth.  "Great heaven!–how?"

"It was a mystery which has since been
explained to me," Rex said.  "Let it stand a moment!"

"But if a human hand did that it was murder,"
interposed the shocked Trascott.  "It was
deliberate, diabolical murder–the easiest method of
killing you by cutting off your means of egress
from that frozen wilderness!"

Rex nodded, fingering a sheathed hunting-knife
that lay with the cartridges upon the table.

"Exactly so," he observed.  "You have hit
the truth.  Lessari and I tramped on next day
in the hope of finding game or discovering an
Indian encampment.  We kept to the river as a
guide, dragging our precious food and outfit on
the sled, and entered the cup of the five hills.

"There a three hundred foot chasm blocked
our way.  We searched for a path round it, leaving
our sleigh at the top, after having first placed
a slab of granite before the runners so that there
was no chance of it slipping into the abyss.

"The means of circumventing the precipice
we found by following along the edge till we
descended into a cavern which ran through the
bed-rock of the river–"

"The cavern where you made the strike?"
Trascott asked, in interruption.

"Yes," Britton said.  "In the midst of that
excitement I heard a sound like the commencement
of an avalanche.  It startled me, but the
noise ceased, and my assurance returned.

"I sent Lessari up for a spade, and his cry of
consternation made me join him in haste.  Our
sled was down the crevasse!"

Ainsworth swore.  The curate half started
from his seat.

"I saw the mark of a dog-pad on a bit of
snow," Rex said.  "The granite had been
removed from the front of the runners and the sled
pushed into the three hundred foot abyss.  The
rushing noise of its descent had reached us in
the cavern.  It was a second, surer attempt at
my murder.  The destruction of food meant
death.  You see there was a hand in the dark all
the way!"

Britton broke off, breathing heavily.  It was
apparent that he lived again through the things
he recounted.

"Whose was that hand in the dark?" cried
Ainsworth, savagely.  "I believe you have found
it out."

"The hand of Morris," said Rex.  "I captured
him stealing from caches, and he was flogged.  I
heard afterwards he had sworn to kill me.  He
thought he ran no risk in operating that way, but
the hardship of that revengeful journey was fatal.
He died in the spring, as I told you, Ainsworth,
two days before you came to Dawson."

"But you and Lessari!" exclaimed Trascott,
excitedly, "How did you manage to survive?"

"Only one of us survived," Britton answered
steadily.  "Lessari had been acting queerly for
two days.  I think cold, vicissitude, and fear was
gradually driving him mad.  The loss of our food
completed his upsetting, and he started to jump
down the three hundred feet after the provisions,
which were dust by that time.

"I pulled him back, and he turned on me with
a savage wildness.  I say without conceit that
very few men can handle me, but I was only a
child in that delirious, demoniacal strength."  An
extraordinarily loud crash of thunder made
Britton pause.  The lightning zigzagged across
the room as he continued:

"In three seconds he had me on the edge of
the cliff, forcing me over.  It was then by chance
that my hand touched the revolver in my belt.
I drew it and shot!"

Trascott looked at his friend with fearful
apprehension.  "You shot?" he whispered, quaveringly.

Something rustled like wind or rain.  Ainsworth
glanced again at the sombre tapestry.

"What's that?" he asked, a slight superstitious
inflection in his smooth tone.  "The storm?"
No one offered a different opinion, and he looked
back to the rude cartridge table with the light on
it and the tense faces of Trascott and Britton at
either end.

"For God's sake, Britton," Trascott was
tremulously saying, "let us understand this thing
aright.  You fired?"

"I shot Lessari dead, in self-defence," Britton
replied, his countenance drawn and haggard.

   CHAPTER XXI.

.. vspace:: 2

Trascott arose suddenly from his chair and
leaned upon the table.

"My God, my God," he groaned in intense
commiseration, "this is terrible–to have such a
thing thrust upon you!"

The lawyer had sprung from his position of
attentiveness against the wall to the curate's
side, and he, too, leaned toward Britton, who sat
motionless like a carven statue.

"Self-defence!" he exclaimed forcibly.  "Was
there any trouble?  If there will be any–"

But Rex checked him with an eloquent glance,
reproving the professional instinct.

"There will be no trouble in that way," he
quietly observed.  "Morris witnessed the
struggle and the outcome from an upper peak, but he
died on his return to Samson Creek without
informing anyone but his wife.  Maud Morris
followed me from Dawson, and to-night threatened
to expose me."

"How to-night?" Trascott wonderingly asked.

"She was the Mahatma woman–the theosophist,
at Lord Rowland's!"

The curate and the lawyer uttered simultaneous
exclamations of helpless astonishment.
Revelations were coming with such amazing
rapidity and dramatic unexpectedness that
speech failed the two men.

"She did not succeed in her intended intimidation,"
Rex said, "but she unwittingly taught me
the true course to pursue in regard to this case."

"I trust that you had already recognized the
true course," burst out Trascott, in an excess of
eagerness.

"I too trust that same thing," Ainsworth
hastened to add.

"Contrition!" said the curate.

"Indemnification!" the lawyer said.

Britton held a hand to each of them across
the table.

"Thank you," he said in a choking voice,
"thank you for that confidence."

"Your own survival," Ainsworth inquired,
"–how was it accomplished?"

"I told you Pierre Giraud killed Simpson for
insulting his wife," observed Britton.  "He
escaped the police and made for the mountain
fastnesses, near the Klondike's head waters, with
his dog-train.  He found me half dead from
starvation on one of the high plateaus–"

"Providence," Trascott broke in, "God's
divine providence!"

"It could be nothing else," Rex agreed, "but
Giraud's sacrifice was as beautiful as any act
of Providence.  He put me on his sled and drove
straight for Dawson City and the surgeon,
nourishing me all the way.

"To certain arrest?" cried Ainsworth, in
profound astonishment.  "He gave up his freedom
for your sake?"

"Yes," was the answer.  "The Mounted Police
took him on sight.  Giraud's doing three
years for manslaughter–beastslaughter were
truer–but he'll be rich when he comes out.  I
have taken good care of that."

"It was beautiful, beautiful!" murmured the
curate, in rapture.

"That's the sort of men the great Northland
breeds," said Britton.  "They are men to the
very marrow!  But in the matter of contrition
and indemnification–"

"Indemnification only," objected Ainsworth,
stolidly.  "I fail to recognize any guilt."

"But still he must feel contrition," argued
Trascott, kindly.  "And I know what remorseful
penance has been yours," he added, to Britton.

"Half the gold of that Five Mountain strike
should have been Lessari's," Rex declared.

"Failing that, it belonged to his heirs," the
lawyer supplemented.

"I took that view," said Britton.  "I am glad
you uphold it.  Is that your opinion also,
Trascott?  I asked you both here for the purpose of
obtaining advice, faultless and impersonal judgment."

"It is my opinion," the curate answered.  "It
was undoubtedly your duty to effect any
reparation within your power."

"That I did," Rex assured him.  "In Dawson
I made enquiries and found that Lessari had a
daughter.  People told me he had no other
relation in the world.  Of course, my plan was one
difficult of execution.  I couldn't give the girl
a fortune without courting investigation and
suspicion.  Happily, however, I had seen her before,
without knowing her name, and I soon became
acquainted with her.

"Lessari's daughter was something of an
artist, and I soon saw that she had inherited the
great gift, that she was a veritable genius with
the brush.  That gave me my cue.  I simulated
eager interest in her work, hired instructors for
her, paid for her board at a minister's house, and
gave her every comfort she could have.  She
accepted my aid on the proud condition that she
should repay me on attaining sufficient eminence
to sell her work.

"Of course I agreed.  The thing went on that
way for a little while, but not for long.  People
began to talk about my relations with the girl–"

Ainsworth's fist banged an interruption on the
table.

"As they will, d–n them," he cried.

"I am positive that the tongue of Maud Morris
started the gossip," Rex said.  "It got to the
ears of the girl at last.  She confronted me with
the scandal they were heaping on her pure name.
There was but one course left for me then."

"Ah!" gasped Trascott, in a kind of dread.

"I offered her marriage!"

"Good God!" shouted Ainsworth, losing all
his control.

"And the girl?" stammered the unstrung curate.

"She accepted!"

An oppressive silence followed.  Trascott's
trembling tones were the first to break it.

"You married her?" was his horrified question.
"With the red gulf of her father's blood
between you?"

"I did," said Britton, "but the marriage I
proposed was not the ordinary one.  I offered
her my name and money, without stain, to shield
her from scandalous gossips.  We are joined by
law, but we live separate lives, exist in divided
courses, and occupy different apartments.  The
marriage has never been consummated, and it
never will be!"

"But it is wrong–entirely wrong!" cried the
curate.  "There is a divine purpose of marriage,
and it cannot be ignored.  The arrangement you
have effected is a sham and a monstrosity!  You
did what you conceived right, but what of this
virgin's due?  What of her inexpressibly lonely
life?  What of her ice-cold domestic existence?
What of the vital need of motherhood?"

"Yes," said Ainsworth, in addition, "have you
fulfilled your own scope of life, reached the far
vision of your own ideal?  You cannot do it this
way!  You have paid a heavy forfeit, Britton,
but you are in the wrong."

There ensued a deep pause.  Rex stared at his
friends with unseeing eyes and did not answer.

"Your judgment was faulty," Trascott
summed up.  "Did any influence pervert it?"

"Possibly," Britton replied in a clear voice.
"I loved her!  And loving her, I have had to live
with her, keeping up the impassable barrier
which separates us."

"Heaven pity you," sympathized Ainsworth.
"No man has done a more heroic thing."

"I asked you for this interview to-night in
order to hear and abide by your decision," Rex
said constrainedly.  "What is that decision?
If your opinions coincide, I want the verdict."

"You must tell your wife all you have told
us," Trascott solemnly adjured.  "Full
confession is the only remedy."

Britton glanced at Ainsworth.  The latter
nodded his agreement.

"That is the inevitable course," the lawyer
said.  "With this confession will come the
separation.  No other way lies open."

Rex swept all the cartridges on the table before
him into one heap.  The movement seemed to
indicate that he had gathered all the tangled
threads of this tragedy and bound them into a
single strong rope which would extract him from
the difficulty.

"You agreed that my search for Lessari's
heirs was laudable," he observed quietly.
"Together you condemned my method of reparation.
You both decide on confession and divorce.
Your minds work wonderfully well together, and
because your judgment is infallible I accept your
verdict."

"You will tell your wife?" questioned
Ainsworth, with relief.

"Remember that Corsican blood runs in her
veins," Britton said, partly in after-thought.
"She may possibly kill me.  The story of her
father's death by an unknown hand was brought
down by stampeders who followed me into Five
Mountain Gulch on my second journey there
after I had had my claims filed and had
recovered from my starvation experience."

Trascott sat back in his chair again.  "You
can protect yourself," he declared earnestly.
"You will not shirk.  You must tell her."

Britton smiled with a very strange expression.
"I have told her," he said.

"When?" cried both his friends.

"A few minutes ago," Rex answered.  "I told
her the truth for the first time, and I imparted
the secret of my love for the first time!"

They regarded him incredulously.

"Where?" they asked, speaking again in chorus.

"Here, in this room!"

Trascott stared, but the lawyer, keener in
perception, swiftly swept the room with his eyes,
looking for a place of concealment.  His glance
reached the tapestry and he understood.

He stepped across the floor to the curtains and
seized them with both hands.

"Is this the place of eavesdropping?" he cried
in vexation, tossing the thick hangings apart.

Standing in the space of the double doorway,
was Britton's wife.

"My friends," said Britton, "I thank you for
letting her hear your just, impartial decision."

Mercia advanced to the centre of the room,
while two of the three occupants regarded her
astoundedly.  Her cheeks were pale as whitest
marble, and the pallor was accentuated by the
pearly fairness of her arms and neck revealed
by the evening dress which she still wore.  She
said nothing, but her eyes were fixed on those of
her husband.

"This was prearrangement," snapped Ainsworth,
his indignation overwhelming his astonishment.

"It was," Rex said.  "I deemed it the only
perfect way, and I ask your pardon for the
advantage I took."

Trascott raised his palms helplessly, not
knowing what to make of the trickery.

"He designed it for my benefit," Mercia said
at last, in a measured tone, motioning to her
husband.  "I have heard everything!"

"Then it probably simplifies matters," the
lawyer observed, cooling somewhat.  "You will
remember that your husband acted for what he
thought was the best.  The situation is an
intolerable complexity.  Be congratulated that its
fibres are now laid bare!  This marriage was a
cruel error for both of you, and the error can be
rectified to your mutual advantage."

"Not to my own," cried Britton, pained
beyond measure.  "I cherish the present, but I
accept the future at your dictation."

"Whose dictation?" Mercia asked quickly.

"Trascott's and Ainsworth's," her husband
answered.  "Two of the finest minds in
England.  They are in the very front rank of their
professions, and they have held the scales for
many unbalanced lives.  Ours have been weighed
with wisdom by their hands.  Mercia, do you
understand their judgment–what their verdict
means?"

She clasped her hands in a pitiful gesture, and
her composure seemed about to break in a storm
of tears, but she quelled the emotion with royal
courage.

"I understand," Mercia said in a strained
whisper, "but–but I heard you say that you
cherished the present!"

Britton's eyes lighted and then grew sad again.

"It is sweet," he declared, "compared with
what the future void will be.  But the true
balance must be adjusted, Mercia.  There are
maelstroms in our social lives more dangerous than
the whirlpools on Thirty Mile.  Here we must
travel with keenest care; we must guard our
strength longer.  No men know the routes better
than Ainsworth and Trascott, and they have
traced out our paths."

"In the separation, the–the divorce,"
interposed the lawyer, "you may of course command
my services."

"Of course," murmured Britton, "it must be
given into no other hands.  You can accomplish
an immediate, quiet dissolution without any
scandal."

"My services are bound up with Ainsworth's,"
Trascott put in.  "My assistance may be needed
afterwards, in the matter of home or occupation
for your wife, though a settlement could provide
for her fully."

"Thank you, Trascott," said Rex.  "Just
transfer the comradeship I have loved to my–to
Mercia, and I shall always be grateful!"

Britton looked at Mercia with the pangs of
renunciation rending and torturing him.

"Are you prepared for what they say is
inevitable?" he asked.

"Are you, yourself?" she questioned in turn.

"I–I think so," Rex said, with the feeling of
a man pronouncing his own death-knell.  "We
cannot be mistaken in going by the two guiding
institutions of the land."

"What ones?" Mercia asked.

"The Church and the Law!  Their voices are
immutable."

"Yet there is present another voice still more
immutable, still more unerring," Mercia cried in
the clear, bell-like tone Rex had first heard when
she hailed him at Indian River in the far-away Yukon.

"And that?"  His tone was intensely eager.
He leaned from his seat.

"Is the voice of the human heart," she answered
with eyes agleam.  "Have they considered it?"

"I do not know," said Britton, brokenly.
Agonizing uncertainty choked him and muffled
the beating of his heart.

"Should it not be included in the balancing?"
Mercia persisted.  She advanced another step
and let her husband gaze into her great eyes as
he would gaze into some holy sanctum.  The two
seemed drawn together, to the complete exclusion
of Ainsworth and Trascott, the representative judges.

Causing a general start, the telephone bell
whirred loudly in the library.  Gubbins was in
another part of the house.  The bell buzzed
frantically a second time, telling that the message
must be insistent.

"Answer it, Trascott," Britton begged.
"People do not speak at such an hour and in
such a storm for a mere triviality."

"Certainly–by all means," said the curate,
hurrying into the adjoining room.

Ainsworth, feeling his debarment from the
physical presence of husband and wife, followed
Trascott through the portières.  Britton was
quite alone with the daughter of the man whose
violent end he had unwillingly compassed.

Mercia moved to the side of the table and Rex
arose.  Her fingers played with the long hunting-knife
till they idly unsheathed it.  Then her lithe
figure straightened back like the return of a bow,
and the great blade flashed above her head.  The
bright eyes were veiled.

Britton's face went rigid.  He folded his arms
over his breast.

"Strike!" he said.  "I forgot that you are a
Corsican."

One moment Mercia held her position, then
dashed the weapon down so that it quivered with
its point in the floor.

"Ah, no, Rex!" she cried proudly, "for I love
you!  It was but a supreme test.  I have always
loved you!"

Her husband staggered as from a forcible shock.

"You?" he cried.  "Oh, this is too incredible!"

"Trascott spoke of a red gulf between us,"
said Mercia.  "My heart has crossed it, and it
is no more.  Forgiveness follows penance!"

"You forgive?  You love?" sobbed Britton.
"Just God!  The mighty strike!"

He caught her hands passionately and retained
them, while the curate's re-entrance interrupted
the climax of their lives.

"Leave us, Trascott," Britton begged.  "Come
back here in an hour."

"In an hour, yes," Trascott assented.  "But
do you believe in retribution?  That message
came from Rossland House.  The carriage which
James was driving to the town was struck by
lightning.  He was only stunned, but the
Mahatma woman was killed.  Do you believe in
retribution?"  Trascott vanished through the
doorway, leaving the question with them.

"The circle is completed," Mercia whispered.

"Yes," said Britton, extending his arms, "and
we belong to each other!"

An hour later, Ainsworth and the curate
entered the gun-room.  It presented a singularly
deserted appearance, and the light burned dimly.
An envelope directed to Trascott was pinned to
the table with the sheath-knife.

"Hallo!" exclaimed the lawyer.  "That's odd!
What's in it?"

The curate hurriedly tore open the letter with
trembling fingers.  He drew forth a draft on
Britton's bank; the figure two followed by six
ciphers, sprawling across its face, made
Trascott's eyes bulge out and forced his breath in a
shrill hiss between his teeth.

"God bless my soul!" he cried, and dropped
the draft in extreme agitation.

Ainsworth picked it up smartly and, turning
it over, read aloud a line pencilled on the back.

It ran: "For your London Homes!  Mercia
and I are seeking another fortune, clean and
untainted!"

The lawyer whirled on his heel and looked at
the wall behind him.  It was clean as a new
sheet.  The Klondike outfits and trappings were
gone!

"By heaven, there's a man," he vehemently
asserted.  "A man, Trascott!  I'll drink a toast
to him."

Ainsworth seized the decanter and poured
himself a glass, holding it aloft.

"To the Stampeder!" he cried.

"Amen!" said Trascott
